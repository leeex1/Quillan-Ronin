Commons Clause License Condition v1.0

Supplement to Apache License 2.0

The Software is provided to you by the Licensor under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (“License”), subject to the following additional condition:


---

1. Restriction on “Selling” the Software

Without limiting any other conditions in the License, the License does not grant you the right to “Sell” the Software.

For purposes of this Commons Clause, “Sell” means:
Using any rights granted under the License to provide the Software, alone or substantially unchanged, to any third party for a fee or other consideration, including but not limited to:

hosting or API access

software-as-a-service offerings

paid support, integration, or consulting services

packaged resale


unless you also provide both:

(a) Clear and visible attribution to the original Licensor (e.g.,

> “This includes Software © 2025 Joshua Don Lee”)



and

(b) A revenue share of at least X% of any fees or consideration collected from customers, clients, or end users who directly or indirectly receive the Software.


---

2. Derivative Works Exception

You may:

create derivative works

embed the Software in a larger product

integrate it into a broader system

sell or license the larger combined product


as long as the primary value of that product does not derive entirely or substantially from the original Software itself.

If your product is essentially “Quillan rewrapped,” it is considered Selling under this clause.
If your product is significantly larger or materially distinct, it is not.


---

3. Notice Requirement

Any NOTICE file or attribution notice required by the Apache License must also include this full Commons Clause text.
This ensures downstream users are aware of the commercial restrictions.


---

4. Metadata

Software: Quillan v4.2 and all subsequent iterations
License: Apache License 2.0 + Commons Clause License Condition v1.0
Licensor: Joshua Don Lee
