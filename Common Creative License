                  Commons Clause License Condition v1.0

   The Software is provided to you by the Licensor under the License
   (Apache License, Version 2.0), subject to the following condition:

   Without limiting other conditions in the License, the grant of
   rights under the License does not include, and the License does not
   grant to you, the right to “Sell” the Software.

   For purposes of this condition, “Sell” means using any rights
   granted under the License to provide the Software, alone or
   substantially unchanged, to third parties for a fee or other
   consideration (including hosting, support, or consulting services),
   **without** providing:

     (a) clear attribution to the original Licensor (e.g., "This includes
         Software © YEAR LicensorName"),
     (b) a **revenue share of at least X%** of fees collected.

   You may develop upon, embed, redistribute, or sell a **derivative
   work** or larger product that includes the Software — **so long as**
   the value does not derive *entirely or substantially* from the
   original Software.

   Any notices required by the License **must** also include this
   Commons Clause text.
