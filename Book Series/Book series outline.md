THE HYBRID THRONE: COMPLETE WORLD OUTLINE (UPDATED)

==============================================================

CORE PREMISE & WORLD FOUNDATION

The kingdom of Aethoria—one of seven interconnected realms—has undergone a revolutionary transformation. After centuries of systematic oppression codified in the Codex Sanguinis, human-animal hybrids have overthrown their persecutors through a combination of legal maneuvering and justified rebellion. At the story's heart lie two lycan brothers: Lukas, who earned respect through battlefield prowess and now serves as Royal Guard Captain, and Fenris, sold into slavery and forged into the assassin known as Shadowfang. Their divergent paths—one toward earned honor, the other toward vengeful darkness—culminate in a confrontation that will determine whether Aethoria's new hybrid-led society can survive its first test of mercy versus justice.
