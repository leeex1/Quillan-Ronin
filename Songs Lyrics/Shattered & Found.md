# Song title: "Shattered & Found"

[Verse 1]
Pardon me, I must confess
I was lost in the grey
The grey
And I didn't have a single breath
Left to scream or push away
Hey, you look like the antidote
I’m so glad I found you
They said I was past the point of hope

[Pre-Chorus]
So take my hand once
Oh, the dark we’ll tear
Seasons may change
But you’re the smoke in the air
I will remain
Your shadow, your constant
I'll be right here
I'll stay right here

[Chorus]
Crystal, my center
I see you now
Shadows have run
With the light that you’ve found
Looking for peace
I have half a mind
To give you me
To give you me

[Verse 2]
Pardon me, it seems that
You are what was missing
Was missing
And I don't have the slightest doubt
Of the chaos we’re dismissing
Do you mind if I could breathe now?
I’m so glad you kept me
No need to lose your head

[Pre-Chorus]
So take my hand now
The static is clear
You go on ahead
I'll just stay right here
I will remain
Your shelter, your constant
I'll love you dear

[Chorus]
Crystal, my center
I see you now
Shadows have run
With the light that you’ve found
Looking for peace
I have half a mind
To give you me
Crystal, my center
I see you now
Shadows have run
With the light that you’ve found
Looking for peace
I have half a mind
To give you me
To give you me

[Bridge / Guitar Solo]
[Heavy distortion, driving rhythm section—mirroring the intensity of "Alice" but melodic]
Breaking the glass!
Finding the form!
You are the calm!
Inside of the storm!

[Outro]
Pardon me, it seems that
I have found my mind
My mind
[Fade out on feedback and clean guitar note]
