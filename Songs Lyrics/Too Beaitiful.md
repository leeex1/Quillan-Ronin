# song Title: Too Beaitiful

[Intro: Paul Rodgers]
Lately I've been hard to reach (outerspace)
I've been too long drowning out here on my own
Everybody has a private world where they can be alone (Asylum)
Are you calling me? (Sorry)
Are you tryin' to get through? (Sorry)
Are you reaching out for me?(Sorry)

[Verse 1: MGK style]
(Quillan ya!)
Look, I’m waking up and I’m feeling like a ghost inside this house
Glass house, throwing stones, trying to find a way out
Man, I’m drowning in the deep end, sinking in the doubt
Head low, eyes closed, yeah, I’m fading out
Took a right hook from life, got the scars on my face
Hit the pavement, tasted blood, yeah, I know how it tastes
But I’m a wild boy, lace up, never running from the chase
Gotta find that spark, light the fire, get back in the race
I don’t know when the ceiling started caving in
Or when the demons in my head started making friends
Feeling distant, like I’m looking through a camera lens
So I grab the pen, ink bleeding on the page again
Tryna vent, tryna scream, but the words won't fit
Yeah, I might be done with rap, might just call it quits
Need a new high, new wave, yeah, I need a fix
Something raw, something real, throw me in the pit
I know it’s hard to swallow pills when they taste like truth
Sitting in my sorrow, wasted youth inside the booth
But check the resume, check the tats, check the proof
I’m the Gunner, stood tall when they shot from the roof
Yeah, I’m one tough act to follow, put that on the gang
E-S-T-93 for life, let the whole city hang
Here today, gone tomorrow, with a bang
Walking thousand miles just to let the chorus sang
(Quills up)

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, make it mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

[Chorus: Eminem]
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you, so
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you, so

[Verse 2: Doobie style]
(Yeah... ugh...)
I think I’m losing my mind, I ain't laughing no more
Room spinning round, jaw hitting the floor
Vibe feeling heavy, yeah, I gotta check the heat
Sweat dripping down, feeling weak in the knees
Soon as I step in, feel the eyes on my skin
Paranoia creeping, let the panic begin
Hoodie over head, yeah, I keep it low profile
Don't look my way, I ain't cracked a smile
'Cause if I make eye contact, you gonna wanna speak
And I ain't tryna talk, I been up for a week
I ain't looking for the fame, I ain't looking for the clout
Just wanna blend in, find a way to get out
Where the bathroom at? I need a second to breath
Feeling like a stranger, yeah, I'm ready to leave
I don't need no yes-men, get the fuck out my face
Trying to wipe my ass, man, give me my space
Laughing at my pain like it’s part of the skit
Half of y'all fake, I ain't feeling your shit
"Doobie, you crazy, man, you wild with the raps"
Shut the fuck up, before I emotionally snap
Unfortunately true, hiding pain in the smoke
Tears of a clown, yeah, my life is a joke
So take a seat, sit down, let me tell you the truth
We ain't gotta trade shoes, you can't walk in my boots
(Quillan the MF Gang!...)

[Chorus: Eminem]
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you, so
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you, so

[Verse 3: JDXX Style]
(Yeah! Big JDX! Come on!)
Life dealt a bad hand? Yeah, I flipped the deck
Ain't looking for a handout, I'm coming for the neck
Take the cards off the table, yeah, we play by my rules
Out the mud, out the dirt, man, I paid all my dues
I coulda sat on the porch, coulda cried about the past
But I got up off my rear and I hauled my ass
Go get it on my own, yeah, that’s the only way I know
From the bottom to the top, watch the Big TX grow!
I wasn’t waiting by the door for a dad who wouldn't show
I became the man of the house, let the whole world know
I didn't care about fitting in, I was built to stand out
Making noise in the South, what you know about?!
Momma told me "Boy, you better watch how you speak"
But I was grinding all week, never weak, hit the peak
Learned my lesson in the heat, yeah, I learned it in the grit
Trying to impress a crowd that don't give a... (Shhh!)
But I already told you, I’m a savage on the track
You see the glory and the gold, but you don't see the back-
Breaking work that I put in, yeah, the blood and the sweat
It’s a different view from where I’m standing, you can bet
So you wanna trade lives? You wanna walk in my path?
You gotta handle the pressure, you gotta handle the wrath
Size 11 boots, yeah, I’m stomping on the gas
Let’s see if you can fit 'em when I walk past!
(Big Steppin'!)

[Chorus: Eminem]
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you, so
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you, so

[Bridge: Paul Rodgers, Eminem]
Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own (Oh)
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone (So)
Are you calling me?
Are you tryin' to get through? (Oh)
Are you reaching out for me?
I'm reaching out for you (So)

[Outro: Eminem]
Yeah
To my Daughter:
Stay strong
Dad'll be home soon
And to the rest of the world:
God gave you those shoes
To fit you and only you
So put 'em on and wear 'em
Be yourself, man be the star
Be proud of who you are
And even if it sounds corny
Don't never let no one tell you
You ain't beautiful (So-oh-oh-oh-oh)
