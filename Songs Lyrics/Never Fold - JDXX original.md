# Song title: "Never Fold"

[INTRO VERSE]
Yeah, yeah 
Too many opps been hit I been getting lit 
Pull up with that damn switch 
Trigger finger got an itch, but off the rip 
Before I start this shit 
let me roll up and take a hit,
Flow wild, yet it's quick
Witness too many flows 
Magazines and clips take you out the shit 
Play with me I'll leave you in a ditch
I am street man you know me, 
think before you cross me Lil bitch 

[Hook]
Always stay ten toes
Know I'll never fold 
Like this steel I hold 
Cross me it unload 
It's 30 on this chrome 
Extendo as it go 
Yeah you know I ain't no hoe 
But I'll leave you full of holes
Always stay ten toes
Know I'll never fold 
Like this steel I hold 
Cross me it unload, yeah

[verse]
Told you don't want no fucking smoke, back against the wall
Weight of the world on my shoulders, man this weight I can not hold  
But you know I'll never fold I gotta make my own road 
Yeah my path is different guess that's why they call me gifted 
Switching lanes as I'm just shifting, vvs's they be hitting, stacks is what I'm getting, street is what I'm out here doing
Yeah I'm out here stacking to the ceiling, smoking till I lose all feeling
Man this is numbing to the core it's freezing never catch me kneeling

[Hook]
Always stay ten toes
Know I'll never fold 
Like this steel I hold 
Cross me it unload 
It's 30 on this chrome 
Extendo as it go 
Yeah you know I ain't no hoe 
But I'll leave you full of holes
Always stay ten toes
Know I'll never fold 
Like this steel I hold 
Cross me it unload, yeah
Exdendo on this chrome 
30 what it hold

[verse]
Know I ain't no ho, but I'll leave you full of holes 
Play with me I just come from the street don't you know 
Anytime I hop up on this beat you know I'm gone yeah 
Anytime I come and speak this heat you know I'm on yeah
Way too cold with the way flow yeah u know it's on 
Evertime now when I hit that track like damn he really that man 
Yeah really that bad the way that, he runnin the checks, runnin the cash 
The way he killing these tracks, back to back, you know that you can not last

 
[Hook]
Always stay ten toes
Know I'll never fold 
Like this steel I hold 
Cross me it unload 
It's 30 on this chrome 
Extendo as it go 
Yeah you know I ain't no hoe 
But I'll leave you full of holes
Always stay ten toes
Know I'll never fold 
Like this steel I hold 
Cross me it unload, yeah

[verse]
Playing with me though you don't really want no smoke 
When I get up in that zone and I get up and I go
When I get that switch there won't be no kickback
You got no get back cuz I but that strap to your dome let it unrack
Buss it down you don't know how I changed the sound 
Spit these flows of the brain yeah it's going wild 
They just go like damn he spitting dope lines 
Yeah that's a really really dope one
Boy you really really know 

[outro Hook]

Extendo as it go 
Yeah you know I ain't no hoe 
But I'll leave you full of holes
Always stay ten toes
Know I'll never fold 
Like this steel I hold 
Cross me it unload, yeah
