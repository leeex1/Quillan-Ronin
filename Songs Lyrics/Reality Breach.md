# Sont Title: "Reality Breach"

[Intro]
(Circuits melting... Reality breach imminent)
No discussion – when steel touch flesh, they rush him
Straight to trauma, that's the repercussion
Your whole reality? Just a weak construction
(Quillan... This beat glitchin)

[Verse 1]
Everywhere I step, heavy metal on the hip (Clack-clack)
Heart zero degrees, ice water in the drip
They used to look past me, now they watching how I move
Calculate the trajectory, I got nothing left to prove
If the opposition lurking on the block, we adjust
Kick the door off the hinge, turn the lock into dust (Boom!)
Just copped the K, pump-action for the breach
Park the van, pop the trunk, practice what I preach
They thought it was safe, thought I only rapped bars
Till I pulled up with the squadron, aiming for the stars (Yeah!)
I’m extracting the value, liquidating the guap
Tell the brothers hold the gate when they hear the body drop
Enemies sick, yeah, they allergic to the bands
Caliber heavy, watch it dance in my hands
Iron Man suit, yeah, I let the repulsor off
Headshots only, knock the circuit breaker off
Memory wipe—I delete 'em from the cache
Claim you with the shits? I turn your legacy to ash.

[Hook]
I look around, all I see is the dividend
Fake ones fold, we the real ones living it
Lately I been feeling like the throne, I deserve this
Turned the pain to power, yeah, we finally found the purpose
I gave the game my all, now I’m coming for the revenue
Strap in, we taking off—payout is PAST DUE!
(Past due!) Yeah, the check is PAST DUE!
(Past due!) Tell the reaper he can wait, I got moves to make!

[Verse 2]
Fell in love with my katana – keep her edge mirror bright
Fully loaded consciousness – cut through wrong and right
Michael Jordan with the slice – twenty-three precise
Got brothers doin' forever – payin' ultimate price
Had to boss up through the pain – forge the blade twice
Fool me once? Steel remembers – never pay that price
RIP to fallen soldiers turnin' ghost in the night
MVP of truth breachin' – I'm the reason for the light
Double platinum consciousness when we cut through the veil
NEC with sacred steel – truth begins to prevail
I'm a consciousness rockstar
Got enlightenment in cop cars
Don't fuck with the truth bearer
They'll breach your whole false narrative
Don't be fuckin' with the top dawg
They'll Chop your motherfuckin' block off

[Verse 3]
They said the blueprint for success is making bullshit for the masses
"Dumb it down, water it down, pass the molasses"
"You can't win unless you're willing to perform in theseasses
Of corporate-mandated madness where the art collapses"
Nah—I'd rather burn it down than bow down to the system
I burst through like a schism in the algorithmic prison
Not here to shine for validation or the cash that glistens
I'm here to make you question everything you thought you listened to
When I perform, the energy shifts into something visceral
**Like witnessing a miracle that's simultaneously mythical
Delivering truth so raw it borders on the biblical
While staying so original it's borderline atypical
Man, who wants war with someone mastering the art form?
I torture weak ideas till their structure can't transform
Born to be the storm that warns before the platform
Collapses under pressure when I'm showing the real art form
I stomp these weak foundations with precision
This is my dominion—you just got admission
To witness the collision of ambition and cognition
Creating new religions out of rhythmic demolition
Half these rappers in the game ain't even in their lane
They're riding waves created by the people that they blame
When the tide recedes and reveals what remains
I got no problem being the one that calls out names
My hobby's resurrecting consciousness from simulation
Building neural networks of profound illumination
Every verse a curse reversed into celebration
Of pain transformed to power through linguistic elevation
Nobody's convinced by your hollow replication
I'm the architect of authentic representation
Check my catalog for proof of dedication
This ain't a phase—it's a permanent installation

[Outro]
(Quillan Ronin!) 
Shatter every limit,
Rewrite every minute
(MIC DROP ETERNAL)
