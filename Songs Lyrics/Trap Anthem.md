# Song Title: Trap Anthem Blade

[Intro Heavy 808s distortion kicks in, hi-hats rattling like a snake ] 
( Producer Tag: "Quillan on the beat..." ) 
Yeah... Sharp edges only. We don't do dull. Cut the check, cut the noise. Let’s go.

[Hook - Lil Baby Style: Catchy, Bouncy, Nasal Tone]
 I got the blade on the hip, watch how I move with the drip (Drip) 
 Cutting the ties, I don’t trip, loaded the clip in the whip (Skrrt) 
 Yeah, I been running the game, diamonds they dancing, they insane (Ice) 
 I put the blade to the pavement, sparking a fire, I’m blazing (Yeah) 
 Money come in and I stack it, tennis chains looking like rackets (Racks) 
 I got the blade in the jacket, too much of this money, can’t pack it (No) 
 Woah, cutting through traffic like zwoosh I got the juice, I got the push (Push) 
 Blade on me sharp like a bush... (cutter) Yeah, blade on me sharp like a cutter.

[Verse 1 - Mo3 Style: Soulful Melody into Rapid Fire] 
[ Melodic start ] 
They tried to count me out, left me for dead in the rain 
I had to sharpen my mind just to deal with the pain 
I put the grind on the metal, I’m creating a spark 
Now I shine in the light, used to live in the dark 
[ Switch flow - Rapid Fire Aggression ] 
But now I’m gunning, I’m running, I’m stunning, I’m coming for everything that they said I couldn’t have 
I’m a savage, I grab it, I bag it, automatic, the static is something that you do not want with the dad 
I’m Mo3 with the flow, three shots at the door, three opps on the floor I reload and I go, put the pedal to floor, hear the engine, it roar 
I cut like a razor, a laser, I phrase it, amaze ya The blade is a part of my nature! Yeah!

[Hook - Lil Baby Style: Catchy, Bouncy] 
I got the blade on the hip, watch how I move with the drip (Drip) 
Cutting the ties, I don’t trip, loaded the clip in the whip (Skrrt) 
Yeah, I been running the game, diamonds they dancing, they insane (Ice) 
I put the blade to the pavement, sparking a fire, I’m blazing (Yeah) 
Money come in and I stack it, tennis chains looking like rackets (Racks) 
I got the blade in the jacket, too much of this money, can’t pack it (No) 
Woah, cutting through traffic like zwoosh I got the juice, I got the push (Push) 
Blade on me sharp like a cutter.

[Verse 2 - MGK Style: Rapid-Rap, Punk Energy, Staccato] 
[ Beat speeds up slightly, snare hits harder ] 
Okay, lace up, face up, pace up I’m running a marathon, better keep up or you’re gone 
I’m a wild boy, blade is Excalibur, caliber high Look in my eye, tell me you’re ready to die 
I’m spitting it rapid, attack it, I map it, I tap it, I snap it The lyrical tactic is graphic, I wreak havoc in traffic 
I’m a rockstar, pop star, cop car chaser Eraser, I rub ‘em out, fear is a vapor See me on stage and I’m raging, the beast in the cage is engaging 
I’m turning the page and I’m aging like wine in the basement But face it, I’m basic-ally insanity placements I cut like a scalpel, precise with the medical Skeptical? 
Nah, I’m just lyrical ethical Blade is aesthetic, my flow is kinetic You don’t get the credit, you read it on Reddit I said it, I meant it, I’m gone! (Bleh!)
