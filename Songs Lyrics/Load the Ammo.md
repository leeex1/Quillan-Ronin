#Song title : "Load up the Ammo"

​[Intro]
Yeah!
Ready to murder the beat
Choppers ready to eat
I stay with that heat
(Quillan on the beat Let’s go!)

​[Hook Lil baby pocket catchy]
Yeah, you know we walk 'em down
We keep all these sticks, we don't play around
Play with me, know you gonna get hit with 30 rounds
Play with me, get put in the ground
Play with me, it's 30 rounds to yo' dome
Play with me, know I want the smoke

​[Verse 1 MGK rapid fire gunner flow]
Let me just come like that
With the way that I rap, you know that I never do cap
When I hop on the track, I run it like that
You know that I get it like that
When I get back with a backpack full of fat raps
Kick flip the track, back to back from the aftermath
Coming back from the backlash of a bad past
Know that I kick right back and know that I kick it like that
Chopper flow when I'm in my mode, never slow
Killing flows, staying way too froze on the microphone
Gotta keep the heater on me just to equal me
But play with me or my seed—key them popping
Like Orville Redenbacher
(Pop! Pop! Pop!)

​[Hook]
Yeah, you know we walk 'em down
We keep all these sticks, we don't play around
Play with me, know you gonna get hit with 30 rounds
Play with me, get put in the ground
Play with me, it's 30 rounds to yo' dome
Play with me, know I want the smoke

​[Verse 2 JDXX chopper catchy articulate flow]
Playing with me? Nah, know I ain't playing games
I just play with this shit because you know I play with flames
Man, I'm out here cooking on this beat, you know I'm going insane
Yeah, it's hibachi in this bitch, how I'm cooking this game
Know I'm going against the grain, my mind insane
Doing my thing, I'm not the same
Fck the "only way" mentality, I make my own lane
Ride my own wave, killing everything on the low
You already know I get up in my mode, let it go
Let it take hold, right off the top the dome
So I stay killing flows in ways unknown
"Impossible" is a word to me that’s just unknown
No matter where I roam on the beat, I spit that heat
So that I speak like a prophet on the beat
Never discrete, just elite, so hit repeat
Never delete, I'm on my grind ready to feast
And turn to a beast, get ready unleashed
Is the mode I'm selected to release
So I hope you are on your knees and made your peace
Say your prayers, you shouldn't have tried to fck with me
This is your funeral recipe

​[Hook]
Yeah, you know we walk 'em down
We keep all these sticks, we don't play around
Play with me, know you gonna get hit with 30 rounds
Play with me, get put in the ground
Play with me, it's 30 rounds to yo' dome
Play with me, know I want the smoke

​[Verse 3 Doobie style ]
Why you want that smoke? Hope you really ready, hope you don't choke
(Hope you ready to go to war)
I don't play like that, nah
I don't play like that
I pull up with gats and straps, let them go
(Rat-tat-tat-ta-tat!)
Why you play with me? Why you play with heat?
Why you tryna play with a gangsta from the street?
Don't understand that my pedigree is elite?
Thoroughbred, top-tier mind that races at speeds
Your mind can't conceive, but best believe
I ain't no simple mark, I’m in a league out of reach
I'm just me, the one, the only
Diamond-hard logic, forged and armed to the teeth

​[Outro Hook]
Yeah, you know we walk 'em down
We keep all these sticks, we don't play around
Play with me, know you gonna get hit with 30 rounds
Play with me, get put in the ground
Play with me, it's 30 rounds to yo' dome
Play with me, know I want the smoke
(We want all the smoke...)
