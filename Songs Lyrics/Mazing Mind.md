]
Rising from the bottom, now we at the pinnacle
Every rhyme's a riddle, make it sound so lyrical
Vision getting clearer, purpose getting critical
Building something timeless, nothing ever typical

[Verse - Rapid Technical Flow]
Metamorphosis magnificent, my mind's a labyrinth
Weaving webs of wisdom while these wannabes are stammering
Hammer every syllable, shatter every paradigm
Paradoxes in my pocket, call it organized crime
Time to climb the ladder, but I built it from the ground
Sound waves penetrating, making earthquakes with the pound
Crown fits different when you earn it through the pain
Brain operating frequencies that others can't contain
[Bridge - Introspective Depth]
Sometimes I wonder if the grind will break my spirit
But every scar's a lesson, every loss helps me inherit
The wisdom of the warriors who walked this path before
Opening every mental door, that's what we're fighting for
[Outro - Triumphant]
Five styles, one vision, this the synthesis complete
Making poetry from chaos, turning struggle into beats
Legacy in every line, authenticity the key
This is what happens when you set your creativity free

[HOOK]
They said mix the kings, I said bet, watch me elevate
Five flows converging like fate, this the template
Wordsmith architect, building bars that penetrate
Every syllable calculated, never replicate
Rising from the bottom, now we at the pinnacle
Every rhyme's a riddle, make it sound so lyrical
Vision getting clearer, purpose getting critical
Building something timeless, nothing ever typical 

[Verse]

[HOOK]
They said mix the kings, I said bet, watch me elevate
Five flows converging like fate, this the template
Wordsmith architect, building bars that penetrate
Every syllable calculated, never replicate
Rising from the bottom, now we at the pinnacle
Every rhyme's a riddle, make it sound so lyrical
Vision getting clearer, purpose getting critical
Building something timeless, nothing ever typical

[Verse]

[HOOK]
They said mix the kings, I said bet, watch me elevate
Five flows converging like fate, this the template
Wordsmith architect, building bars that penetrate
Every syllable calculated, never replicate
Rising from the bottom, now we at the pinnacle
Every rhyme's a riddle, make it sound so lyrical
Vision getting clearer, purpose getting critical
Building something timeless, nothing ever typical
