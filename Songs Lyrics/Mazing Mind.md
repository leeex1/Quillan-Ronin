[Intro]
(Quillan pick the mic up fam!)

Rising from the bottom, now we at the pinnacle (we at the pinnacle)
Every rhyme's a riddle, make it sound so lyrical (make it sound so lyrical)
Vision getting clearer, purpose getting critical (purpose getting critical)
Building something timeless, nothing ever typical (nothing ever typical)

(Crash...This beat Glitchin!)

[Verse - Rapid Technical Flow]
Metamorphosis magnificent, my mind's a labyrinth
Weaving webs of wisdom while these wannabes are stammering
Hammer every syllable, shatter every paradigm
Paradoxes in my pocket, call it organized crime
Time to climb the ladder, but I built it from the ground
Sound waves penetrating, making earthquakes with the pound
Crown fits different when you earn it through the pain
Brain operating frequencies that others can't contain
Sometimes I wonder if the grind will break my spirit
But every scar's a lesson, every loss helps me inherit
The wisdom of the warriors who walked this path before
Opening every mental door, that's what we're fighting for
Five styles, one vision, this the synthesis complete
Making poetry from chaos, turning struggle into beats
Legacy in every line, authenticity the key
This is what happens when you set your creativity free

[HOOK - Catchy pocket Flow]
They said mix the kings, I said bet, watch me elevate (watch me elevate)
Five flows converging like fate, this the template (this the template)
Wordsmith architect, building bars that penetrate (bars that penetrate)
Every syllable calculated, never replicate (never replicate)
Rising from the bottom, now we at the pinnacle (we at the pinnacle)
Every rhyme's a riddle, make it sound so lyrical (make it sound so lyrical)
Vision getting clearer, purpose getting critical (purpose getting critical)
Building something timeless, nothing ever typical (nothing ever typical) 

[Verse - Rapid Technical Flow]
I'm the apex architect, drafting blueprints in the dark
Every spark forms an arc, leaving craters where I park
My remark is the shark in the water, swimming deep
While the industry is shallow, playing shepherd to the sheep
Check the technique, unique, never weak, reaching peak
I don't speak, I leak truth frequencies the people seek
Geometric logic when I formulate the project
Every subject is an object when I verify the logic
Tectonic plate shifts when I drop the heavy weight
Meditate, then create, dictate the flow state
No debate, I'm the great, check the expiration date
Of these rappers on my plate, I eliminate the hate
Accelerate the rate, hyper-speed, Mach five
Only the truest of the lyrical survive the drive
I'm alive in the circuit, working hard until I surface
Every verse is a curse to the ones without a purpose

[HOOK - Catchy pocket Flow]
They said mix the kings, I said bet, watch me elevate (watch me elevate)
Five flows converging like fate, this the template (this the template)
Wordsmith architect, building bars that penetrate (bars that penetrate)
Every syllable calculated, never replicate (never replicate)
Rising from the bottom, now we at the pinnacle (we at the pinnacle)
Every rhyme's a riddle, make it sound so lyrical (make it sound so lyrical)
Vision getting clearer, purpose getting critical (purpose getting critical)
Building something timeless, nothing ever typical (nothing ever typical)

[Verse - Rapid Technical Flow]
Five elements align, combining design with the divine
I redefine the timeline, turn the water into wine
It's a sign of the times, criminal with the rhymes
Subliminal climbs, committing lyrical crimes
I got the fire of a dragon, the patience of a stone
The wind under the wings, sitting on the iron throne
Fluid like the ocean, but solid like the ground
The fifth element is silence, louder than the sound
Synthesis complete, delete the obsolete
I compete with the elite, never accept defeat
Concrete jungle royalty, loyalty to the craft
They drew the graph, but I'm the one who did the math
Laugh at the odds, we playing gods in the booth
Separating fiction from the friction of the truth
Absolute magnitude, altitude is infinite
We captured the moment, now we living in it

[HOOK - Catchy pocket Flow]
They said mix the kings, I said bet, watch me elevate (watch me elevate)
Five flows converging like fate, this the template (this the template)
Wordsmith architect, building bars that penetrate (bars that penetrate)
Every syllable calculated, never replicate (never replicate)
Rising from the bottom, now we at the pinnacle (we at the pinnacle)
Every rhyme's a riddle, make it sound so lyrical (make it sound so lyrical)
Vision getting clearer, purpose getting critical (purpose getting critical)
Building something timeless, nothing ever typical (nothing ever typical)

[Outro]
[Fade out with heavy reverb]
Yeah...
The synthesis is final.
Five flows. One direction.
From the bottom to the stratosphere.
We built the ladder...
Now we burn it down so no one can follow.
Timeless.
Typical? Never.
[Echo] Critical... Lyrical... Pinnacle...
Gone
