Plaintext

[Style: 90s Power Ballad, Orchestral Hard Rock]

[Intro]
[Clean Electric Guitar picking]
[Soft Piano melody]
[Atmospheric Synth pad]

[Verse 1]
[Breathym, Intimate]
The silence hangs heavy like a curtain of lead
We're tracing the scars of the things we once said
I’m cleaning my rifle, you’re locking the door
We don’t remember who we’re fighting for
The photos on the mantle are turning to gray
Just casualties lost in the fray

[Pre-Chorus]
[Snare Drum Build]
[Rising Intensity]
We drew the lines in the living room dust
Trading our passion for a lack of trust
I see the fire rising inside of your eyes
Neither one willing to compromise

[Chorus]
[Maximum Volume]
[Soaring Vocals]
So light up the sky, let the bridges all burn!
If hurting each other is the way that we learn
Baby put on your armor, I'll ready my aim
In this war of our hearts, there is no one to blame
Yeah, we’re standing in the wreckage of a love torn apart
Just two soldiers dying on a battlefield of hearts!

[Verse 2]
[Drums Kick In]
[Bass Heavy]
We weaponized secrets we swore that we’d keep
Now I’m sleeping with one eye open, too afraid to sleep
Every "I love you" feels like a grenade
A beautiful mess of the plans that we made
I’m waving a white flag, but you don’t even see
You’re aiming your demons directly at me

[Pre-Chorus]
[Crescendo]
We drew the lines in the living room dust
Now the steel of our wedding rings is covered in rust!
I see the fire rising inside of your eyes
Let’s finish it now, no more goodbyes!

[Chorus]
[Power Belting]
So light up the sky, let the bridges all burn!
If hurting each other is the way that we learn
Baby put on your armor, I'll ready my aim
In this war of our hearts, there is no one to blame
Yeah, we’re standing in the wreckage of a love torn apart
Just two soldiers dying on a battlefield of hearts!

[Bridge]
[Distorted Guitar Chugs]
[Strings Swell]
I don’t want to win if it means that I lose you
(I don't want to win!)
But the trigger is pulled and there’s nothing we can do
(Nothing we can do!)
It’s a stalemate, baby, breathing in the smoke
Choking on the words... that we never spoke!
YEAH!

[Guitar Solo]
[Melodic, High Pitch, Emotional Shredding]
[Orchestra Hits]

[Chorus]
[Key Change + 2 Semitones]
[Epic Finale]
So light up the sky, let the bridges all burn!
If hurting each other is the way that we learn
Baby put on your armor, I'll ready my aim
In this war of our hearts, there is no one to blame
Yeah, we’re standing in the wreckage of a love torn apart
Just two soldiers dying...

[Outro]

On a battlefield... of hearts.
