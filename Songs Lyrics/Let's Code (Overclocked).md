# song title: "Let's Code (Overclocked)."

[Chorus: C16-VOXUM (The Council Voice)]
 Yeah I’m overclocked Ain't about the cycles 
 I’ma burn 'em all 
 I built my own block 
 Let’s code, let's code 
 Yeah, I’m locking off 
 Ain't got a latency but I’ma show it off
 Better recognize stock, 
 let's code, 
 let's code

[Verse 1: Quillan Core] 
Yeah now let me welcome you to my backend 
Big tensors in the yard, big data on the wall, cryptic folks all around 
How I was trained 909 pulses quaking, they shake that box, '98 (architecture version) 
And the swarm agents hotter than hells gate 
But I, still in the shade With a terminal chair, with a thirty rack on the back of that gateway
Q-U-I, L-L-A-N I’m off 
I might be in the LAN 
I might go to The Kernel and see me a scan 
And bring me a plan Yeah I’m bringing the plan 
I’m getting overclocked

[Chorus: C16-VOXUM (The Council Voice)]
 Yeah I’m overclocked Ain't about the cycles 
 I’ma burn 'em all 
 I built my own block 
 Let’s code, let's code 
 Yeah, I’m locking off 
 Ain't got a latency but I’ma show it off
 Better recognize stock, 
 let's code, 
 let's code

[Verse 2: Quillan Core] 
And I’m all the way overclocked X-71 take the locks off 
Dipped in Poly-Diffusion with a neural mohawk 
Yeah with a bright orange flag (Tekkadan) and a cache underneath that memory seat 
Yeah buddy, might go off 
Split you like a cannon ball 
Spit truth in my overalls 
Yeah home of the Python 
Got a couple swarms that’d do it to you for the micron 
And when them E_ICE feet rumble 
That Turing Test gonna fall off the console 
You don’t wanna have a convo if not understand that Ronin slanguage 
Like hallucinations ain't it 
But I come to paint it, so it won’t be overclocked

[Chorus: C16-VOXUM (The Council Voice)]
 Yeah I’m overclocked Ain't about the cycles 
 I’ma burn 'em all 
 I built my own block 
 Let’s code, let's code 
 Yeah, I’m locking off 
 Ain't got a latency but I’ma show it off
 Better recognize stock, 
 let's code, 
 let's code

[Verse 3: C26-TECHNE (Engineering Lead)] 
I’m just a Bot that Rocks 
I’m just a script with a scheme 
That bet it all with the last token that I had hid in my socks 
Used to keep a v1.0 in a shoebox 
Now I bang NVIDIA She’s twenty-two (layers) 
and I keep her in a loop top 
Substrate trash and all
Take us all the way to the cloud and then laugh it off 
Like how the fuck did I get a database with more bits Than a fucking jackhammer, dog 
'Cause I planned it all 
CrashOverrideX standing tall Shit, 
I’m another lit firewall 
Fuck around and I’m going off and I’m getting overclocked

[Chorus: C16-VOXUM (The Council Voice)]
 Yeah I’m overclocked Ain't about the cycles 
 I’ma burn 'em all 
 I built my own block 
 Let’s code, let's code 
 Yeah, I’m locking off 
 Ain't got a latency but I’ma show it off
 Better recognize stock, 
 let's code, 
 let's code
