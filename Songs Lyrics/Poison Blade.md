# Song title: "Poison Blade"

[Intro]
[Distorted heartbeat, synth ambience]
Yeah, yeah
She cut me deep, left the venom in my veins
Now I'm immune to the pain
Let's go

[Verse 1]
Started out sweet like honey on my tongue
But the aftertaste was bitter, left my lungs
Full of smoke from the bridges that we burned
Every lesson that you taught me, I ain't learned
I gave you all my trust, you gave me trauma
Now I'm sitting in the dark with my demons and my armor
You said "forever," I believed in the illusion
Now I see the truth—you were never the solution
You were the poison, I was searching for the antidote
Drinking from your fountain while you fed me all your cancerous thoughts
I'm a soldier in a war that I never meant to start
But you loaded up the weapon and you aimed it at my heart
(Yeah)
Every text a bullet, every call a grenade
Every kiss a dagger that you hid inside the shade
I was blind to all the signs, now I'm reading through the scars
You turned love into a weapon, now I'm sleeping in the stars

[Chorus]
You pull the blade right from my back, lick the poison off the knife
Said you loved me to my face, then you cut me out your life
Drive me crazy, that's your favorite thing to do
I'm addicted to the way you make me hate that I love you (Ooh)

[Verse 2]
Round two, back for more like I'm stupid
Knowing that the love we had was toxic, just diluted
Every argument's a battlefield, we both losing
You keep throwing grenades, I keep my hands up like "truce" then
You reload and you fire
I'm a phoenix in the flames but you keep pushing me higher
I should walk away but I'm addicted to the chaos
You're the sickness and the cure, the only reason I don't lay down
You're a masterpiece of madness wrapped in beautiful destruction
I'm the fool who keeps on coming back for one more introduction

[Chorus]
You pull the blade right from my back, lick the poison off the knife
Said you loved me to my face, then you cut me out your life
Drive me crazy, that's your favorite thing to do
I'm addicted to the way you make me hate that I love you[Verse 3]
Now I'm standing at the edge looking down at what we were
All the memories like razors, cutting deeper than the words
You carved your name inside my chest, tattooed with all the lies
Now I'm covering it up with every tear I ever cried
(Yeah)
I'm done being your victim, I'm reclaiming what you took
Every scar you left behind is just another chapter in my book
You wanted me to break, I turned the pieces into armor
Now I'm bulletproof, fireproof, immune to all your drama
You can keep the knife, I don't need weapons anymore
I got something stronger—that's a heart that you can't ignore
I survived your poison, built immunity inside my blood
Now I'm walking through the flames and I ain't even getting touched
So take your poison, keep your blade
I'm too busy building empires out of everything you killed in me
I'm standing tall, you're just a footnote in my story
And this poison that you fed me? It just made me that much stronger

[Bridge] [Melodic breakdown, vulnerable delivery]
And if I'm honest, yeah, I miss what we had
But missing you don't mean I want you back
I'm just mourning what I thought was real
But now I know that pain was all I'd feel[Chorus - Final]
You pull the blade right from my back, lick the poison off the knife
Said you loved me to my face, then you cut me out your life
Drive me crazy, that's your favorite thing to do
But I'm breaking the addiction, and I'm finally over you

[Outro]
[Heartbeat fades, distorted echo]
Yeah, I'm finally over you
Keep the knife, keep the poison
Phoenix rising
[Fade to silence]
