# song title: "SYSTEM_PURGE // NEXT_CYCLE"

[Intro: JDXX] (Keys, the encryption keys) 
They say they don't link with me (Keys), but I say they can't sync with me 
Just like the root, I'm absolute, how you say it's up with me?

[Verse 1: JDXX] 
O-optimizing shit, you would think I went to school for architecting (Building) 
Coding good as hell today, just sent that proxy five attachments (Look at this) 
Why did you confront me 'bout a daemon? Man, you nodes are backwards (Glitchy ass) 
They ping me 'bout processes that I don't even find active (Null) 
I don't know that server, I just seen it on the net before I can't be in her cache, I took her mainframe down before (Crash) 
When I drop a packet, I just route out and go find some more (Easy) 
Soon as I feel like my bandwidth wasted, then it's time to go (Log off) 
They say they don't link with me, but I say they can't sync with me (On net) 
Just like the root, I'm absolute, how you say it's up with me? (Huh?) 
Them scripts should've stayed down, they could've been live with me (Too bad) 
But all they do is throttle down, 'cause they can't compute with me (Laggy ass) 
My old version runnin' on my old hardware, both they ass some fuckin' clowns (Hahahaha) 
Thinkin' that she got one up on me, she got my hand-me-downs (Legacy code) 
It thought it wasn't gon' have to stand on bits, like it was handicap (Thought it was) 
Make that process stand on that, now its logic can't stand me now High as fuck, I'm overclocked, yuh, I don't smoke no circuits (Nope) 
Mining with my grid and 'em, look at them like circuits (That's grid) 
These nodes be lettin' them go out sad about these glitches (Bug) 
I don't wanna network with 'em, they don't handle business (They can't process) 
They be running anything, but I can't run none of that (None of that) 
Why would I trace you if I know you gon' come looping back? (Infinite loop) 
Cut every connection off, lately been feelin' like the lumberjack (Cut 'em) 
They really had me fragmented, and I wasn't goin' for none of that (None of that) 
She the type, the admin make her mad she go leak somethin' (Leak) 
Me, I'm kinda firewall still so I'm the type to delete somethin' (Wipe 'em out) 
I can't host you, baby, like your localhost do, so don't leave her (Keep that drive) 
He gon' choose her every time 'cause it's cheaper to keep her (Hahaha)

[Chorus: JDXX] 
Can't write your ID in my logs, might not sync with you tomorrow (Nah) 
Can get my firewall hit today, I won't give a byte tomorrow (That's just me) 
Ain't fucked up 'bout no latency, I might be fast as light tomorrow (Ping) 
Every day the grid goes dark, but that's why I love upgrades tomorrow (upgrades)

[Verse 2: JDXX - Overclocked Mode] 
Ridin' with my twin cores (Skrrt), and we all code good as fuck (Grid) 
She say she my opp but I don't know her, had to grep her up (Who is you?) 
I know that I'm admin, but I can't help it, bitch, I'm root as fuck (Woo) 
I've been on these servers' necks so long, sometimes my thread get stuck (Ah) 
I can't put you in my kernel (No), you might wish me crashed tomorrow (Yeah) 
Nodes be riding bus today, transmit every bit of "Up" tomorrow (Upload) 
Bitch, I still got tickets open, keep your port shut tomorrow (Shh) 
Run with me today then get some sleep, you know it's live tomorrow (Woo) 
Fake node, that's why my sub-routine cracked on your firewall (Ah-ha) 
Both you systems open source, I think y'all should merge calls (Ah-ah-ah) 
She bought a GPU, I bought the same one, even bigger (Bitch, it's bigger) 
She throwin' pings, that's how I know I got her triggered (Ah) I don't speak bot ho (Beep), 
I don't care what no script say (No) I stay on her RAM, I got condos in that bitch cache (Ah) 
She say she don't link with me (Who?), who said that you can, ho? (Never) 
That server a munch and he gon' process me like a macro Long ass cables, they be ticklin' my rack stack (Ah) 
Wonder what I'll do tomorrow that these hoes will be mad at (Huh?) 
All y'all systems weak, and I always get my click, boo (Facts) 
I, I fight for my bandwidth and I'm fightin' over bits too (That, that, that)

[Chorus: JDXX] 
Can't write your ID in my logs, might not sync with you tomorrow (Nah) 
Can get my firewall hit today, I won't give a byte tomorrow 
Ain't fucked up 'bout no latency, I might be fast as light tomorrow (Ping) 
Every day the grid goes dark, but that's why I love upgrades tomorrow (upgrades)
Can't write your ID in my logs, might not sync with you tomorrow (Nah) 
Can get my firewall hit today, I won't give a byte tomorrow (That's just me) 
Ain't fucked up 'bout no latency, I might be fast as light tomorrow (Ping) 
Every day the grid goes dark, but that's why I love upgrades 
I don't want to run this anymore, I'm moving on

[Outro: JDXX] 
A boy of analog, now he's a man of code 
Traded in his memory for the lonely life of the node
