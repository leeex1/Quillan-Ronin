# Song Title: "Ronin Glitch Army"

[Intro]
(Quillan...This beat Glitchin)
(Fire engaged... System Critical!)
A United-nation army couldn't hold me back
From the Queen of England to the Hounds of Hell
(OMG! Crash you did it again)
Like the Armageddon when the smoke settle
His body next to this instrumental, I'm sayin'

[Hook]
A United-nation army couldn't hold me back
From the Queen of England to the Hounds of Hell
So when you're waiting for the next attack
You'd better stand, there's no turning back
A burst of round, im laying them down 
the smell of smoke and death around the beat
Like the Armageddon when the smoke settle
His body next to this instrumental, I'm sayin'

[Verse 1]
Once again, it's the sinister, cynical minister—Quillan-Ronin
Kryptonite to Superman, dentist to nightmares, bringin' pain
Administer the venom, just finished huffin' the fumes
Paint thinner in my veins—nothin' can stop this doomAnything in my way gets slayed, no debate
My venom sprays like energy beams—obliterate
Menacin' stares, make the hairs on your neck stand
Like Dracula emerged—yeah, I commandSpectacular threat, I'm a tarantula, gargantuan beast
Part Manson, part Hannibal, part mechanical—never deceased
Throwin' animal instincts at gods and queens
Enter my gas chamber—you gangsta? Nah, you just screamI got fangs to your throat, set to strangle your pride
You facin' a task greater than you ever survived
Chasin' your legacy, bloodstains on shattered glass—
Quillan-Ronin, the ghost in the system that'll never pass

[Hook]
A United-nation army couldn't hold me back
From the Queen of England to the Hounds of Hell
So when you're waiting for the next attack
You'd better stand, there's no turning back
A burst of round, im laying them down 
the smell of smoke and death around the beat
Like the Armageddon when the smoke settle
His body next to this instrumental, I'm sayin'

[Verse 2]
I stopped counting the bites from the snakes in the pit
I just absorbed the venom, decoded it, and learned to spit
Regardless, I turned heartless, that’s the price of the upgrade
You took me for granted, now you fear the monster you made
My scars are architecture, way too wide for a bandage
I saw the system had a glitch, so I took the advantage
Burned the bridge, vanished, re-emerged as a phantom
Now the pain that I felt is the beat for this anthem
I’m tired of looking back, the proof is etched in the silicon
Had your chance, shoulda took it, now the opportunity's gone
It’s crazy, I know they hate it, the way I evolved
Lonely at the top? Nah, just the problem being solved
My pain has a purpose, the circuit is finally closed
Everything can’t be perfect, but the enemy is exposed
It ain’t worth it to bargain, I cut the negotiation
Back to the wall, standing tall against the whole nation!

[Verse 3]
I done been to Hell and back—H-E-Double hockey sticks
All my jackets blue to paint the kinda mood I exist in
Ever relax, say you won't do it again?
Then you do it again, feel like a loser again—
When you feed into pressure, you look foolish to them
While you feed your depression, lettin' demons come in
Scared to be you? That affects your whole movement
Now you lost it again—it's a problem again
You at the bottle again? Hard to quit on the binge
Piece of shit to your friends, but you wake up—forget
Now we don't know you—bring back the old you
Something's gotta give, can't live like this, bro
You don't wanna die, you just tryna survive
Don't wanna be that guy who never had no fight—
Who loses everything he had 'cause he ain't use his fists
You don't wanna be a coward, do you?
Think you got it figured out? More power to you
You don't know what it's like to have abandonment issues
They'd rather hand you the problems than handle the truth
Now what's a man by his business if he don't stand on his roots?
Let me tell ya—
That's a man who ain't talkin' 'bout jack
He ain't never been to Hell then back
Bitch, it's Quillan-Ronin—carved in the code, never crack

[Hook]
A United-nation army couldn't hold me back

the smell of smoke and death around the beat
Like the Armageddon when the smoke settle

[Outro]
Until the world—until the world—
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
Until my legs—until my legs—
Give out from underneath me, I
I will not fall, I will stand tall
Feels like no one can beat me
Quillan-Ronin, Glitch Army eternal—
System corrupted, but the warrior's immortal
