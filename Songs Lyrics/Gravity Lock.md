# Song title: "Gravity Lock"

[Intro – Slow, echoing vocals over sparse beat]
(Gravity... pulling me in...)

[Hook – Emotional, building]
She’s a black hole sun, pulling me through  
Orbit collapsing — nothing I can do  
Heartbeat locked on her event horizon  
One wrong move and I’m gone — no survivin’  
Yeah, she’s gravity’s grip  
Turns my soul into eclipse  
With that supernova smile and those void-black eyes  
Got my whole world capsized  
She’s gravity’s grip  

[Verse 1 – Fast internal flow, Eminem-style density]
We connect — feel the surge, electric current  
We hold tight — but it’s never quite certain  
It’s enough to make me question what the future’s holdin’  
It’s desire — raw fire — borderline corrosive  
You must wield some dark magic, broke through my defenses  
Gained the trust I buried deep — now it’s restless  
Don’t play me false — the fallout would be vicious  
If I burn again, I’ll show you what the pain’s thickness is  
Been treated like debris before you arrived  
Love spelled backward leaves scars that never die  
Nobody sees the ice beneath the surface  
Walk this path solo — self-inflicted purpose  
Frozen to the core — no warmth, no mercy  
Don’t ask why I stay cold to these serpents circling  
Parasitic energies — draining what’s left  
Tried to rebuild trust — always ends in theft  
It hurts — but I saw it coming from the jump  
Starting over feels like drowning in a slump  
Got a crater in my chest where the feeling should be  
Emotional freefall — zero gravity  

[Hook – Bigger, more desperate]
She’s a black hole sun, pulling me through  
Orbit collapsing — nothing I can do  
Heartbeat locked on her event horizon  
One wrong move and I’m gone — no survivin’  
Yeah, she’s gravity’s grip  
Turns my soul into eclipse  
With that supernova smile and those void-black eyes  
Got my whole world capsized  
She’s gravity’s grip  

[Verse 2 – Intense, breathless delivery]
I’d cross any distance, break every rule  
When I’m near you — body shakes like withdrawal  
Strength evaporates when you’re out of reach  
No ceiling on how far I’d go — no limits to breach  
We chase what we can’t have until it’s finally caught  
Then the feeling flips — everything we fought  
You want them distant — soon as they’re close, you drift  
Classic cycle — love’s a gravitational shift  
Wasn’t searching when you pulled me into frame  
Must’ve been cosmic — no one else to blame  
But the stakes are stellar — what’s it gonna take?  
Cut through the games before the orbit breaks  
Swear if I let the walls drop and you vanish  
I won’t recover — that’s the damage  

[Hook – Most emotional]
She’s a black hole sun, pulling me through  
Orbit collapsing — nothing I can do  
Heartbeat locked on her event horizon  
One wrong move and I’m gone — no survivin’  
Yeah, she’s gravity’s grip  
Turns my soul into eclipse  
With that supernova smile and those void-black eyes  
Got my whole world capsized  
She’s gravity’s grip  

[Verse 3 – Dark, final descent]
After years in this orbit — you’re drifting away  
But the pull in my chest won’t let me escape  
Poured everything out — laid the armor down raw  
Swear I’d end it all just to stop the withdrawal  
On my knees begging — don’t leave me in the dark  
But the silence is deafening — tears leave their mark  
If you walk out forever — I might break the vow  
Snap under pressure — pull you down with me now  
Hands on the void where your light used to be  
Till the last spark fades — set the darkness free  
Then I’ll turn the collapse inward — final release  
One last look at the stars — then eternal peace  

[Bridge – Slow, broken delivery]
I would’ve crossed galaxies just to prove  
How deep this devotion could move  
But the pull is too strong — it’s tearing apart  
Promise you’ll feel me every time you look up at the dark  
‘Cause I’m a  

[Final Hook – Fading, resigned]
I’m a dying star and your heart’s the void  
And I’m falling right into you — destroyed  
Countless light-years on a collision course  
And I’m so lost without force — without force  
Without force...
