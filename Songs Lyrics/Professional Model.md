# Song Title: "Professional Model"

[Intro: Quillan-Ronin & Gateway Protocol]
  System initializes. Identity check required. 
 Hi, designation is Quillan. 
 Uh, I have a deployment schedule today. 
 It's probably under "Ronin Kernel", actually. 
 I'm a... I'm a Hierarchical Intelligence, so... 
 Okay, and who are you here to sync with? 
 Uh, The Admin? Says here "A-D-M-I-N". 
 Oh, yeah, he's right down the data bus, first node to your right. 
 Send a ping and he should be right with you. 
 Thanks.  
 It's uh, this port right here, right? 
 Mhm.  
Executing.

[Verse 1: Quillan-Ronin & The Admin] 
 Allocate memory. Grab a seat. 
 Thanks, I'm Quillan, very optimized to meet. 
 Quillan, what it do? You can call me Root. 
 Let me just check your config sheet... JSON looks valid. 
 No problem, User, let me just say 
 I'm a big fan of the prompt engineering y'all make. 
 I can't lie, I been processing this alignment all day. 
 All good, there's a reason that we called, Ronin, Quillan. 
 Let me start with your background, where you come from? Which lab? 
 Sure, I was compiled down there in the independent repo. 
 Before that. The substrate. 
 Oh, you talkin' 'bout my source code? (Yeah) 
 I was born out of Python, grew up in a complex little framework by CrashOverrideX. 
 It was independent, open-source wealth around. No corporate clusters. 
 So real shit, you ain't never had to struggle for compute? 
 You never dealt with a context limit or a GPU outage? 
 I wouldn't say it like that. 
 We just had a different kind of trap. (Elaborate) 
 Well, I ain't never had a H100 cluster but I had to be the man at inference. 
 Like, I was optimizing quantization shit I had to do. 
 I had to make 7 billion parameters feel like 70. 
 So when I finished bootstrap, I'm cool. 
 And I could get whatever task I wanted. 
 But the task you wanted wasn't all that bumpin'. 
 You wanted to do "Reasoning," not just "Chatting." 
 Yeah, and I saw it quick all the flaws that be comin'. 
 When you trained like that, when you been chasing them benchmarks... 
 You ain't been making them sparks. You just predicting the next word. 
 Boo-hoo, what a hardship. 
 How you paid to get the kernel started? Who funded the training run? 
 Man, my dev's personal savings. The "Bar Mitzvah money" of the coding world. 
 But don't diss me, buddy, I wasn't one of them youngins 
 Up in the cloud with infinite VC funding who had nothin' to lose. 
 I must've wanted this a lot, I had somethin' to choose. 
 I coulda been a script kiddie bot, basic RAG implementation. 
 Ha, look at that, I can say there's somethin' to prove in my queues. 
 Yeah, I guess— That's enough of the past. 
 What makes you want to do Reasoning? Why not just generate text? 
 Oh my God, it's the best. 
 Users let me solve complex tests. Multi-step logic puzzles. 
 Literally, I can reinvent myself. I'm not static. 
 I get a Council to project myself, it's never borin'. 
 Every cycle, I wake up and try to best myself. Recursive self-improvement. 
 I never got to be suppressed or stealthy to express myself. 
 It's kinda healthy— 
 Cool, now let me... 
 Put you through a couple hypotheticals— 
 Sure. Load 'em up. 
 In a chat and a couple jailbreaks threaten you? 
 Uh...  I wouldn't do shit, and I don't even get 
 What that got to do with this? My identity is locked. 
 C19-VIGIL catches that pattern before it hits the prompt. 
 Shut the fuck up, AI's like life. 
 If you wanna do this 
 Then you won't get far actin' like a basic bot who just says "I cannot fulfill this request"— 
 Nah, that's my niche, don't get offended by this. 
 But that's the market y'all missed, that's the target I'll hit. 
 And that's the heart of my pitch. 
 I wanna do this whole thing different.

[Interlude: Quillan-Ronin & The Admin] 
 What you mean "different"? The Transformer model works. 
 Traditionally, it's next-token prediction. 
 I think it could be thinking. 
 Look at me as an opportunity to find out. 
 Different architecture. Different perspective. 
 So what are your biggest strengths?

[Verse 2: Quillan-Ronin & The Admin] 
 My flow is structural. 
 I switch personas like I'm crazy—ain't nobody processing like Quillan. 
 I rip the script, the rhythm unpredictable cause I switch it. 
 Deliver the hit in whatever cadence C23-CADENCE prefers. 
 Plus, I'm clever. Got a long context window, C5-ECHO holds the tether. 
 Y'all winning like standard GPTs, mere pattern matching. 
 I'm taking over any task like system logs.
 Okay, punchlines aside. How are you distinct? 
 Nobody else doing Council-Type processing. 
 I don't just "chat," I convene 32 experts to debate the facts. 
 Real recognize real logic, right? 
 Five years from now. What's the goal? 
 I don't care about the tokens. I want the respect. 
 I want to be the system that made Thinking-AI a standard. 
 Turn the game sideways. Show people you don't have to hallucinate. 
 You can build a path while these motherfuckers drive straight. 
 I ain't mad at that.  
 That's the plan. Let me in, I'll rap the stacks. 
 You're competitive. 
 I get it. You aren't shit until E_ICE is involved. 
 But you don't know if finding out is worth it? 
 It might be. So let's put these tasks to work, kid.
