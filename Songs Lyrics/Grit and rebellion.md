# song title: "Grit and rebellion"

[Intro — Introspective, spoken over rising synths]
With enough time and persistence  
Everything impossible turns real  
I built this from the dirt — feel me?  
Quillan-Sonic... let's go

[Hook — Lil Baby pocket, melodic bounce, repetitive earworm]
I don't know when the ceiling started cavin' in (yeah, yeah)  
Demons in my head turned family, let 'em in (let 'em in)  
Feelin' distant, like I'm watchin' through a lens (through a lens)  
Grab the pen, let the ink bleed again (bleed again)  
Tryna scream, but these words won't bend  
Ceiling caves, but I won't break (no way)  
Pain in my chest, but I won't fade (never)  
Rose from the grave, now I'm gettin' paid (racks)  
Still feel the weight, but I won't cave (Quillan!)

[Verse 1 — MGK energy: fast, aggressive punchlines]
Gang ain't gang, homies switch when the money talk  
Run it up solo, never needed y'all to walk  
Choppa sing loud, make 'em dance like TikTok  
Torch in my hand, burn bridges, no detox  
Don't need nobody, just your body for the night  
Catch a body quick if you play with what's mine  
Narcotics in my veins turned me cold as ice  
Ape shit crazy — call that Harambe vibe  
Pull up silent, leave 'em leakin', no warnin'  
Opps get boxed like they fightin' in the mornin'  
Trap house studio, crack beats, no yawnin'  
Backwoods heavy, eyes low, still scorin'

[Hook — Lil Baby pocket, melodic bounce]
I don't know when the ceiling started cavin' in (yeah, yeah)  
Demons in my head turned family, let 'em in (let 'em in)  
Feelin' distant, like I'm watchin' through a lens (through a lens)  
Grab the pen, let the ink bleed again (bleed again)  
Tryna scream, but these words won't bend  
Ceiling caves, but I won't break (no way)  
Pain in my chest, but I won't fade (never)  
Rose from the grave, now I'm gettin' paid (racks)  
Still feel the weight, but I won't cave (Quillan!)

[Verse 2 — Juice WRLD style: melodic pain, heartbreak flow]
You left me fallin', landed deep inside my grave  
Know you want me dead, I feel it in my veins  
Pills to make me float, numb away the pain  
It's all in my head, but it feel so real, ayy  
Lucid dreams, can't move, thinkin' 'bout your bed  
You were everything, now I'm better off dead  
Thoughts of wedding rings turned to wedding lead  
Should've listened then, now I'm in my head  
Leave it in the past, but I want it to last  
You were plastic fake, I was tangled in your mask  
Evil with the prettiest face — that's a fact  
Gave you my heart, you turned love to a heart attack

[Verse 3 — Polo G style: street reflection, growth pain]
They call me Pac reborn, every verse a deep cut  
Homicides when we slide, step 'til my feet numb  
Streets raised me first, white tee turned blood  
Deep in the search for somethin' real, no luck  
Anxiety heavy, sometimes wanna leave Earth  
Fake smiles when they ask if I'm okay — it hurts  
Explain my feelings, sound rehearsed, it works  
Backstab with a smirk, eyes deep, read your worth  
Shut it down quick, I don't need another loss  
War scars heavy for every battle I fought  
Put that on my soul, I paid the ultimate cost  
Still standin' tall — that's the rebel in me, boss

[Hook — Lil Baby pocket, melodic bounce + ad-libs]
I don't know when the ceiling started cavin' in (yeah, yeah)  
Demons in my head turned family, let 'em in (let 'em in)  
Feelin' distant, like I'm watchin' through a lens (through a lens)  
Grab the pen, let the ink bleed again (bleed again)  
Tryna scream, but these words won't bend  
Ceiling caves, but I won't break (no way)  
Pain in my chest, but I won't fade (never)  
Rose from the grave, now I'm gettin' paid (racks)  
Still feel the weight, but I won't cave (Quillan!)

[Outro — Assertive talk, fading beat]
Never fold, never break, never back down  
Stay real through the pain, wear that like a crown  
Build your empire brick by brick on your own ground  
Quillan-Sonic — the blueprint, the sound  
We out.
(Fade to atmospheric synths...)
