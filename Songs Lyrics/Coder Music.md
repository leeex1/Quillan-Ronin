# Song Title: Coder Music

[intro catchy anthemic ]
Yeah, yeah... This that real one
southside to the death of me
Let's ride...

[Verse 1 rapid fire mgk rapid fire flow]
Came up from the bottom where the shadows stay creeping
Lost count of the nights when the streets wasn't sleeping
Got scars on my conscience and heat in my possession
Every move calculated like a Bobby Fischer session
They want me in a box, six feet with the flowers
But I move through the dark like I'm bending the hours
Wayne taught me double meaning, Baby taught me patience
Logic in my structure while I'm racing with the ancients
Dodging every setup, every snake in the garden
Heart turned to steel, no apologies or pardons
This pressure make diamonds, or it shatter your composure
I stayed solid through the winter, now the summer getting closer
Money on my mind like it's tatted on my frontal lobe
Eleven deep, no weak links in this brotherhood we chose
From nothing to something while they plotting my demise
But I see through the illusion with my third and fourth eyes

[Chorus proud catchy anthemic ]
This that mothafuckin' coder music
This that mothafuckin' coder music
All night, when I'm rollin'
Dirty, how many times you gon' play with death before you 30?
But I'm chosen, so I'm rollin'
With 11 of my closest, on a mission to get rich like Danny Ocean, how we rollin'
All through traffic with this mob apparatus
These people want me in a casket, still I'm rollin'
I heard Heaven got a place for me there, but I don't know if I'm goin', uh

[Verse 2 rapid fire mgk rapid fire flow]
Started with a dream and a conscience full of demons
Now I'm counting blessings while they plotting and scheming
Every loss a lesson, every win a validation
Built an empire off ambition and pure desperation
They said I wouldn't make it, now they study my progression
Changed the whole equation while they stuck in regression
Got that Doobie in my DNA, that grit within my core
MGK rebellion mixed with something even moreI don't do the politics, I do the execution
Every verse a revolution, every hook a contribution
To the culture that raised me when I had nothing
Now I got everything and still I'm out here hustling
Paranoia in my rearview but I'm pushing through the noise
Made it out the trenches with my dignity and poise
They want me to fold, want me to break, want me to cry
But I'm built for this pressure—watch a real one multiply

[Chorus proud catchy anthemic ]
This that mothafuckin' coder music
This that mothafuckin' coder music (Southside, ayy)
This that mothafuckin' coder music
This that mothafuckin' coder music
All night, when I'm rollin'
Dirty, how many times you gon' play with death before you thirty?
But I'm chosen, so I'm rollin'
With 11 of my closest, on a mission to get rich like Danny Ocean, how we rollin'
All through traffic with this mob apparatus
These people want me in a casket, still I'm rollin'
I heard Heaven got a place for me there, but I don't know if I'm goin', uh

[Verse 3 rapid fire mgk rapid fire flow]
Every scar tells a story of survival and resilience
Came from where the sirens sing and violence is the brilliance
Had to learn the hard way that your circle make or break you
Some will love you to your face then turn around and snake youSo I move with precision, got my vision tunnel narrow
Shooting straight for the target like a flaming arrow
They can't dim my light even when they try to shade me
Made it through the storm that was designed to degrade me
Logic in my left brain, chaos in my right
Balance out the madness, turn the darkness into light
This that therapeutic music for the ones who really get it
Who done seen the worst of life and still won't let it limit
All the trials and tribulations forged a different metal
Can't be broken, can't be shaken, never will I settle
For the mediocre, average, or the comfortable
I was born to be uncomfortable—that's what made me wonderful

[Chorus proud catchy anthemic ]
This that mothafuckin' coder music
This that mothafuckin' coder music (Southside, ayy)
This that mothafuckin' coder music
This that mothafuckin' coder music (Turn up)
All night, when I'm rollin'
Dirty, how many times you gon' play with death before you thirty?
But I'm chosen, so I'm rollin'
With 11 of my closest, on a mission to get rich like Danny Ocean, how we rollin'
All through traffic with this mob apparatus
These people want me in a casket, still I'm rollin'
I heard Heaven got a place for me there, but I don't know if I'm goin', uh

[Outro]
This that real coder shit, you feel me?
For everybody who came from nothing
And refused to go back to nothing
We out here... Southside 'til the death of me
Quillan in the building... Let's ride
