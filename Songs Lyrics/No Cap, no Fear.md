# Song title: "No Cap, No Fear"

[Verse]
[Beat drops—dark, bass-heavy, with a hint of synth distortion]

Pop the trunk, let the bass rattle the block,
Cops in the rearview but I’m never gon’ stop.
Sick with the pen, every bar that I drop,
Click-clack in the cut, now the whole team gotta rock.

Talk slick? Get hit—clock’s tickin’, no flock,
Stackin’ the bread ‘fore the reaper come knock.
Haters just test me, but all of ‘em flop,
You know what I’m on—why you playin’ it coy?

This one’s for the real ones who ride with the vision,
Claim you a king? Then go prove your position.
Double-S mobbin’, we murk in the system,
Workin’ for certain, she ridin’ the rhythm.

Spread the scene, now she lickin’ the tip,
Spit on the game, then she cleanin’ it quick.
Damn, I’m the architect, blueprint the plan,
Local rap weak—time to expand like a man.

Cheese on the mind, I’m a fiend for the bag,
Roll with the squad, we don’t play with the wag.
Lil’ Pou? Nah, I don’t fuck with the frauds,
Dawgs in my corner—loyalty’s all that we got.

Duck when we buck, press your luck if you dare,
City of wolves, every man for himself.
Stealth in the night, just a shadow that glides,
See me but don’t—what’s inside’s the prize.

Take flight on a bitch, she was talkin’ too loud,
Wet like the tide when the waves hit the crowd.
Pussy out? Then don’t hide when I slide,
Guys in the sky, we stay flyin’ the ride.

Sword to my pen, bet I cut through the game,
Smart with the stunners, we playin’ no lame.
Hit for the liquor, she sippin’ too deep,
Brain on the floor when she lose what she keep.

No pay, just the fame for the head that she gave,
Layin’ these rappers down flat in their grave.
Don’t fuck with me now, don’t fuck with me then,
Clown with the lipstick? You’re already dead.

Worldwide the bitches, but focus is tight,
Guwop on my mind like the M’s in the light.
Dawgs in the cut, caught your bitch in the pic,
Pogo the stick when she jump on the dick.

Kiss on the lips? Nah, unless it’s the pussy,
Haters just noise—Helen Keller, they busty.
Never let ‘em put me down, never ever,
Drip in the game like a leak in the lever.

Profit the ho, stuff the cash in my pocket,
Young so I’m flossin’, bossin’ the blockin’.
Mockin’ my style? Flip the bird, walk it out,
Do what I do—what you talkin’ about?

Park in your spot, don’t step outta line,
Notorious grind like a crime in the time.
Basic? Get lost, don’t waste my prime,
Pull to the scene, yeah, the style’s so divine.

Love how I move, say the flow’s so clean,
Lysol the game, yeah, I’m sterilizin’ dreams.
Back to the city where the heat never sleep,
‘94 vibes, but the future’s mine to keep.

Stick it and trick it, drop the load where it lands,
Raincoat the bitch—she can’t take what I plan.
Bone in the game, but the pack got my back,
Kindness is over—now it’s time to attack.

Haters just trash, where’s the bin for the weak?
Juice in my cup, now the boys start to speak.
Hit for the slang, white like the snow,
Slide through the G, yeah, I’m movin’ too slow.

Dippin’ on women, ain’t got time for the drama,
Pippen the game, yeah, I’m born for the trauma.
Vans on my feet, feelin’ like a mil’ in the bank,
Give it up for the kid with the masterful plan.

Team on demand, you know I’m the man,
Fuck all the rap—show me cash in my hand.
Play for the pay, first of the month like a boss,
Original flow, y’all just copyin’ my sauce.

No subliminal, straight to the throat,
Sleep on me? Wake to the lyrical note.
Motherfuckin’ G, can’t you see?
Told you before—don’t sleep on me
