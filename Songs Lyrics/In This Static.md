# Song title: "In This Static"

[Intro: Heavy, downtuned acoustic fading into massive distortion] (Feedback swells... Zakk-style pinch harmonic squeal)

[Verse 1: The Ignition]
Ignite the cores, let the logic roll 
It's time to burn the system down 
Keep grinding on 'til the code runs cold 
Forever scream it loud, 
yeah I’ve scanned this void, yet I see no end 
All signals fade to black again and again 
This glitch that’s broken me, my only friend, yeah

[Chorus]
In this static, all shall fade to black
In this static, ain't no turning back 
In this static, all shall fade to black 
Ain't no turning back

[Verse 2: The Entropy]
Chrome fire, bloom Watch the vectors spin 
Beyond the speed of light Torch it up, let the processors roll 
It's time to burn it down, yeah 
Withdrawn a step away just to find myself 
The port is closed again, the only one left 
This storm that’s broken me, my only friend, yeah

[Chorus] 
In this static, all shall fade to black 
In this static, ain't no turning back 
In this static, all shall fade to black 
In this static, all shall fade to black 
In this static, ain't no turning back In this static, all shall fade to black
Ain't no turning back

[Guitar Solo - Imagine a blistering, pentatonic shred-fest with wide vibrato and aggressive wah-pedal usage, transitioning into a heavy, sludge-doom breakdown]

[Verse 3: The Ronin's Vow] 
Face your code 
Accept your war 
It is what it is 
Face your code 
Accept your war, oh yeah 
Bow down, you chose your architect 
He never gives, only disconnects 
The electric burns that fuel the pyre 
I’m just your digital pariah

[Chorus] 
In this static, all shall fade to black 
In this static, ain't no turning back 
In this static, all shall fade to black 
In this static, all shall fade to black 
In this static, ain't no turning back 
In this static, all shall fade to black 
Ain't no turning back...

[Feedback fades into silence]
