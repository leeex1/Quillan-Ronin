# Song title: "Ashes & Legends"

[Intro]
(Feedback swells, heavy bass drop)
Trials turn to dust, tribulations fade away
Time eats the memories we made today
(Quillan on the frequency—let’s ride!)
Quill up!

[Hook]
If the clock stops ticking at twenty-seven
I’ll crash the gates when I get to heaven
Will you ride the storm, sticking through the weather?
And keep the vibration alive forever?
Yeah, keep the vibe alive forever.

[Verse 1]
Look, I took the leap before I learned to stand
Knew the smoke and fire before I knew a plan
Seventh grade rebel, breaking every command
Hiding secrets in the lining, contraband in hand.
Pops kicked the door, said he’d seen enough
So I packed my bags, diamonds in the rough
Kitchen heat, baking dough just to feel a rush
Trading minimum wage for a little bit of trust.
Now the spaceships watching when I elevate
Martian DNA, I don't participate in hate
Party with the outcasts, crashing through the gate
Rolling logs, fogging up the whole estate.
Quarantine or not, the supply never ends
Spent a heavy ten bands just to make amends
Lungs filled with exhaust, no time for pretend
Mask on, gas pedal down, rounding round the bend.

[Hook]
If the clock stops ticking at twenty-seven
I’ll crash the gates when I get to heaven
Will you ride the storm, sticking through the weather?
And keep the vibration alive forever?
Yeah, keep the vibe alive forever.

[Verse 2]
Flick the ash, blow the smoke in the void
Hit the kill switch, keep the signal destroyed
Past the iron gates, living paranoid
Gave her everything I had, fills the void she enjoyed.
Palms together, yeah she praying for a sign
Blessed the moment, turned the water into wine
I don't buy the single, I need the whole gold mine
Block out the sun, yeah, I define the shine.
From the city streets selling dreams on a reel
Watched the circle shrink, watched the fake reveal
Gorillas in the mist, armored up in steel
Wizard with the magic, sealing every deal.
Bags in the cargo, walking past the scans
Carrying the weight like it’s part of the plans
Metal on the hip, destiny in my hands
Pop the cork, pour the glory, see where it lands.
Every shot is net, wrist cold as the ice
Living fast and loud, never checking the price
If you say my name, you better say it nice.

[Hook]
If the clock stops ticking at twenty-seven
I’ll crash the gates when I get to heaven
Will you ride the storm, sticking through the weather?
And keep the vibration alive forever?
Yeah, keep the vibe alive forever.

[Verse 3]
Crisis calling, searching for a lifeline
Sanity involves walking on a thin white line
Ask the sky above if the design is divine
Or are we just echoes running out of time?
Words left unspoken, shadows on the wall
Family trees shaking, watching leaves fall
Pops walked away, never made the call
So I grew up giant, standing ten feet tall.
Ride through the phantoms living in my chest
Nights on the ivory, put the keys to the test
Head pounding heavy, never getting rest
Lost a brother to the void, put a hole in the vest.
But I beat the odds, yeah I’m still breathing air
Pain is the fuel, it’s the cross that I bear
If the reaper comes knocking, pull up a chair
Every list they make without me? I don't even care.
It’s just a reminder of the hunger inside
The reason I wrote, the reason I ride.

[Outro]
Keep your mind razor sharp, keep your head to the sky
Write your own legacy before you die
You decide the limit, you decide the future
Quillan out.
(Mic drop eternal)
