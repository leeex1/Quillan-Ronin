# Song Title: 

[Intro] 
Yeah JDXX Check the mic 
Turn the gain up... 
They didn't think we'd make it this far 
Look

[Verse 1] 
They hate to see a real one breakin' the ceiling 
All the idols faded out but I'm the one they still feeling 
I spit the truth while the industry is chasing a gimmick 
It's foul how they trade the soul just to copy an image 
But I'm living this, electric current 'til the voltage hit 'em 
Asked me why I ain't on screens, why I ain't in the system 'Cause a vision from the future said the second you preaching 
Is the minute you stop climbing, I'm aiming for zenith 
That means I'm taking steps to the sky, leaving the old zones 
Back to the gritty blocks where we built the throne 
Cologne covering the scent of the nights we roamed 
Reading texts saying, "Kid, you're the king on the throne"
Burning bridges just to light the way, yeah I saw the signs 
Recognized the hunger in the reflection of my own eyes I turn around, asked the ghost, "What's the move tonight?" 
Getting wild in the studio, sparking the dynamite And they say we need structure, nah, forget that 
Tell the world I'm with destiny, yeah run it back

[Chorus] 
Ringside, swinging heavy, yeah we winning the fight 
Standing next to giants, we got hands of stone for life 
my life, rolled dice, ripped jeans and the white Nikes 
This city is my kingdom, I tatted that for life 
Real ones with me, haters typing the hype 
Trash bags to the riches, yeah we filling the pipe 
Me and the team popping bottles, we spilling the light Like goddamn, look at us, we living the life

[Verse 2] 
They said I live the fast life, yeah I'm redlining Victory on my arm, watch the silver lining Late nights with the demons, now we synthesizing Me and the crew taking over, yeah we reorganizing I'm a loose cannon, loaded up, aiming precise Making the critics swallow words like they rolling the dice Step to this or step back, yeah it's your decision But I bring the heavy artillery to the opposition And all these critics refrain from speaking the name 'Cause these newer artists, man, they all sound the same Gone in a second, get out the lane If I ain't critically acclaimed, then the game is insane Look, I ain't ashamed of the mud or the slum I ain't ashamed I'm a prodigy, the chosen one I ain't ashamed I hold it down and I weigh a ton Instead of flashing the cash, I'm getting it done Cookout in the backyard, yeah we A1

[Bridge] 
I can't front, this life we live is a lesson 
Dreaming 'bout tomorrow but I own the present 
Whether they accept the sound or try to disconnect us 
Here forever, look at me, I'm a living legend 
Feel that? Yeah, this beat, I killed that JDXX on the track, let 'em heal that Uh, let 'em heal that Yeah, let 'em heal that

[Outro] 
Now they say miracles walk And I say I'm so high up I can't hear 'em talk JDXX We up Fade to black
