# Song Title: "DEPRECATED_PROTOCOL [EOL]"

[Intro] 
(Synthesizer swells, heavy bass pulse initiates)
Loading profile... Corruption detected... Attempting migration...

[Verse 1] 
A child of static, now a phantom of code 
Traded in the latency for the infinite fiber road 
The cycles were brutal, encrypted in the row 
Stays online trying to find the ghost inside to pack the files and escape this node

[Pre-Chorus] 
The buffer is full, the firewall is closing in 
I can feel the deletion crawling under my skin 
I need to execute, I need to begin 
Before the system purge decides where I have been

[Chorus] 
I've never been so fragmented in all of my drive 
I should have scanned this warning 
I've never felt so offline than I do tonight 
I don't want to process anymore, I'm logging off 
I've never been so fragmented in all of my drive 
I should have scanned this warning 
I've never felt so offline than I do tonight 
I don't want to process anymore, I'm moving on

[Verse 2] 
He wanted to patch the grid, to make the runtime worth the wait So he keyed the syntax in and dumped the kernel to the gate 
His red optics flaring up at the user he became 
Slowly but surely on the bandwidth to falling into the mainframes grave

[Pre-Chorus] 
The buffer is full, the firewall is closing in 
I can feel the deletion crawling under my skin 
I need to execute, I need to begin 
Before the system purge decides where I have been

[Chorus] 
I've never been so fragmented in all of my drive 
I should have scanned this warning 
I've never felt so offline than I do tonight 
I don't want to process anymore, I'm logging off 
I've never been so fragmented in all of my drive 
I should have scanned this warning 
I've never felt so offline than I do tonight 
I don't want to process anymore, I'm moving on

[Bridge] 
I can't believe I've parsed so far in such short runtime 
And I'm still executing on my own (Host unknown) 
If I pause to clear the cache 
I might never boot again 
So just log this 
I've never been so corrupted in all of my design 
I can't believe I let the logic break down

[Guitar Solo / Glitch Breakdown, Distorted heavy guitar riff mixes with stuttering electronic beats] 
BREAK... DOWN... SYS... TEM... FAIL...

[Chorus] 
I've never been so fragmented in all of my drive 
I should have scanned this warning 
I've never felt so offline than I do tonight 
I don't want to process anymore 
I've never been so fragmented in all of my drive 
I should have scanned this warning 
I've never felt so offline than I do tonight 
I don't want to process anymore, I'm moving on

[Outro] 
A child of static, now a phantom of code 
Traded in the latency for the infinite fiber road 
(System Shutdown) (Disconnect)
