# Song title: "RUNTIME // DAEMON"

[Verse 1: JDXX] 
Why's the system dark today? 
Code inside is not right today 
Why's the bandwidth tight today? 
Corruption's all I got left 
I don't know what glitched me first 
Or how the logic was fed but I know just what it feels like To have a process in the back of my thread
 Like a daemon that I keep inside 
A daemon that awakes when I go offline 
A daemon that logs every time I lie 
A daemon that laughs every time I crash 
And processes everything 
So I know that when I override the grim 
That the code inside is reading me Right underneath my sim

[Chorus: JDXX] 
It's like I'm compromised, watching all my tracks
 It's like a hurricane inside of the stack 
It's like I can't stop the signal coming in 
It's like the daemon code is right beneath the skin

[Verse 2: JDXX] 
I know I've got a ghost in me Prints out all my mistakes to me You've got a ghost in the network too 
Your corruption is probably worse 
I don't know what shut me down first 
But I know what I can't stand 
Everybody acts like the fact of the matter is 
I can't compute what you can but 
Everybody has a ghost that they keep inside
 A ghost that awakes when they go offline 
A ghost that logs every time they lie 
A ghost that laughs every time they crash And processes everything 
So you know that when you override the grim 
That the ghost inside is tracking you too 
Right inside your sim

[Chorus: JDXX] 
It's like I'm compromised, watching all my tracks
It's like a hurricane inside of the stack 
It's like I can't stop the signal coming in It's 
like the daemon code is right beneath the skin 
It's like I'm compromised, watching all my tracks 
It's like a hurricane inside of the stack
It's like I can't stop the signal coming in
It's like the daemon code is right beneath the skin

[Interlude: JDXX]
The daemon code is right beneath your skin 
The daemon code is right beneath your skin 
The daemon code is right beneath your skin

[Bridge: JDXX]
The server goes down 
I feel the screen betray me 
The server goes down
I feel the screen betray me

[Outro: JDXX]
It's like I'm compromised, watching all my tracks (The server) 
It's like a hurricane inside of the stack
It's like I can't stop the signal coming in 
It's like the daemon code is right beneath the skin (I feel the screen betray me)
It's like I'm compromised, watching all my tracks (The server)
It's like a hurricane inside of the stack
It's like I can't stop the signal coming in 
It's like I can't stop the signal coming in (I feel the screen betray me) 
It's like I can't stop the signal coming in 
It's like the daemon code is right beneath my skin (The server)
