# 🎸 "CHROME HEART SYNDROME"
 *A Quillan Original*



 [Intro]

Yeah, uh
Different energy, same chaos
Chrome hearts, black cards, no laws
Let me talk my shit real quick
(Quillan on the track, you already know)




 [Verse 1]

Woke up in a hotel I can't pronounce the name of
City skyline looking like a video game, bruh
Last night's a blur but my bank account's the same, tough
Money counter going *brrr* while I'm getting brain, what?

Convertible roof missing like my inhibitions
Shawty in the passenger got expensive addictions
She don't love me, she in love with the lifestyle provisions
Gucci on her body but her mind need some fixing (Facts)

I'm the type to buy the bar just to close it down early
Pearl white interior, the seats are looking pearly
Wake up 4 PM, call that rising early
Life moving fast but my vision never blurry (Nah)

Pour another drink, roll another situation
Bad decisions make the best documentation
She said "You're too reckless," that's an understatement
I'm just living proof that karma got some patience




 [Hook]

Chrome heart syndrome, can't feel nothing anymore
Money in the mattress, pills on the bathroom floor
Told her "Stick around if you can handle what I got in store"
Success taste sweeter when you've been hungry and poor (Yeah, yeah)

They said I'd never make it, now they need a feature
Pour up in my cup until I can't feel either
Love or pain, it's all the same when you're a believer
In the chaos, in the madness, I'm a overachiever (Let's go)




 [Verse 2]

Wrist so froze, call it permanent winter
Social media flexing but my life's on the splinter
Between genius and madness, call me Tarantino's printer
Writing scripts in my head while I roll up the dimmer

Studio sessions turn to therapy sessions
Confessin' to the microphone all my obsessions
Depression's just ambition with some negative investments
I'm investing in my vices while I'm counting all these blessings (Huh)

Lamborghini engine sound like a orchestra
She say I'm too much but she keep coming over, bruh
Toxic as the chemicals I mix up in my soda cup
But we both adults, so we both know what it's boutta become

Chain swinging like a hypnotist pendulum
My future looking bright even though my past is so sinister
They want me to fall off but I'm just getting better, bruh
Each verse I write, another level, call it leveling up (Yeah)




 [Hook]

Chrome heart syndrome, can't feel nothing anymore
Money in the mattress, pills on the bathroom floor
Told her "Stick around if you can handle what I got in store"
Success taste sweeter when you've been hungry and poor (Yeah, yeah)

They said I'd never make it, now they need a feature
Pour up in my cup until I can't feel either
Love or pain, it's all the same when you're a believer
In the chaos, in the madness, I'm an overachiever




 [Verse 3]

Look, authenticity's expensive in this culture
They want you vulnerable but judge you like a vulture
I'm just trying to make sense of this beautiful torture
While building an empire on top of my impostor (Syndrome)

Penthouse views but I'm still seeing ceiling cracks
Millions in the bank but I'm still feeling feelings that
Money can't erase, pills can't replace
The emptiness that comes when you're winning every race (Real talk)

She ask me "When you gonna slow down and settle?"
I'm like "Baby, I'm allergic to the conventional"
Success is my addiction, ambition is my chemical
Every day I'm pushing limits that they said were impossible (Facts)

I'm not glorifying nothing, I'm just being honest
Came from nothing to something, yeah that's just my promise
To everyone who doubted, to everyone who wanted
To see me stay stagnant while they living in the tropics

Now I'm tropical, unstoppable, philosophical
Living life illogical but somehow staying logical
Methodical with money moves, my mind is economical
She want all of me but I'm just being optional (Sorry)




 [Final Hook]

Chrome heart syndrome, can't feel nothing anymore
Money in the mattress, pills on the bathroom floor
Told her "Stick around if you can handle what I got in store"
Success taste sweeter when you've been hungry and poor (Yeah, yeah)

They said I'd never make it, now they need a feature
Pour up in my cup until I can't feel either
Love or pain, it's all the same when you're a believer
In the chaos, in the madness, I'm an overachiever (Yeah)




 [Outro]

Chrome heart syndrome
Yeah, that's the diagnosis
Living life in doses
While they spectate from the nosebleeds

I'm courtside with the chaos
That's word to Quillan
Original vision
No imitation, just innovation
