# Song Title: "Lethal Angel"

[Intro whisper vocals]
[Guitar riffs and pinch harmonics]


[Hook anthemic proud savage]
That girl, she's a loaded gun
Gonna take 'em out take 'em one by one
She knows when she's dressed to kill
She'll put a bullet in your heart just to feel the thrill

Cuz she's hell on heels
And she turns my wheels
With her devil smile and her angel eyes
She got me all hypnotized
And she's hell on heels

[Verse 1 90s chad kroger style vocals]
I took the pills, I’ve been consumed
I drank the water, I had to choose
I’m still here with a fire burning, burning inside
If you want to burn, light it up, light up, let it rise
No time to hide
I'm alive on the inside
Breaking up my mind on the front lines
Will I survive? Will I survive another day?
This great divide
Side by side on the inside
Breaking up our minds on the front lines
Never again, never again will I be denied

[Hook anthemic proud savage]
That girl, she's a loaded gun
Gonna take 'em out take 'em one by one
She knows when she's dressed to kill
She'll put a bullet in your heart just to feel the thrill

Cuz she's hell on heels
And she turns my wheels
With her devil smile and her angel eyes
She got me all hypnotized
And she's hell on heels

[Verse 2 chester clean screaming vocal style]
She walks like she's walkin' on water
She moves like the boss's daughter
She rides like a '67 Chevy
In her drop top red and white and blue

Ohhh, what she does to me
With her long dark hair and her sexy thighs
Baby let me come inside

[Hook anthemic proud savage]
That girl, she's a loaded gun
Gonna take 'em out take 'em one by one
She knows when she's dressed to kill
She'll put a bullet in your heart just to feel the thrill

Cuz she's hell on heels
And she turns my wheels
With her devil smile and her angel eyes
She got me all hypnotized
And she's hell on heels
