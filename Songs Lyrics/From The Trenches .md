# Song Title: "From The Trenches To The Throne"

[Intro]
(Ah-ah-ah-ah) They said id never make it 
(Ah-ah-ah-ah) They said i would fail 
(Ah-ah-ah-ah) Mayday! Mayday!
they said it was impossible

[Tagline]
(OMG Crash you did it again!)

[Hook]
Where were y'all when the nights were cold? Got questions
Now the room's packed wall-to-wall with new connections
Just met a family, vibe went wrong in seconds
They caught the scent of the future I just collected
Let 'em talk – pressure builds legends
I don't break, I just sharpen the edges

[Verse]
Lyrically, I'm seven dimensions deep
Like Jordan in his prime—unstoppable heat
Engineered for dominance, precision, elite
I'm a rocket, you're a bicycle seatI'm the apex predator, no surrender sign
Gonna feed these people what they crave—their time
I could tell your crew they're safe—that'd be a crime
'Cause I'm rewriting history in every single lineRolling in that midnight beast, no license plate
Got a ledger full of targets, duct tape, y'all ain't safe (ugh)
Clinically, I'm possessed by this art I create
Industry's infected, full of counterfeits and snakes (ugh)Money trees (ugh), powder dreams (ugh)
Straight through the cortex, drowning screams (ugh)
Just being honest (ugh), somewhat monstrous (ugh)
I carved this throne and they won't acknowledgeYeah, I'm Caucasian, yeah, I bring that soul
Yeah, my daughter's biracial, yeah, I break the mold
Yeah, I'm a fighter, yeah, I rose from cold
Beast mode activated since I left the kennel
And that ink on my partner's face ain't sentimental

I don't break, I just sharpen the edges

[Verse]
They say the legends been hibernating (waiting)
Now the OG's back, dominating (skating)
On chrome and gold, no imitations (Dayton's)
My legacy's the only thing they're debating (-sation)
When it comes to who they envy from a distance
But I don't need validation for my existence
Just wipe it off like rainfall on my istence (nothing)
I'm the certified king of that grimy terrain (dirty)
Put in decades so I've earned my reign (worthy)
And I'm scorching—like a crown on a giant frame
Sitting sideways on artillery, yeah, thirty rounds (30s)
So don't pretend you didn't hear me (heard me)
'Cause I'll have to educate you on reality
And you know my résumé, you know my current state
Let me show you what I'm destined to create (what's up?)
Gonna put my borough on the atlas (okay)
Then I'm locking down that legacy (that's tight)
Post up in the crucible (alright)
Then elevate my people to the light (that's what's up)
Teach 'em how to hustle, how to climb that vertical axis (ladder)
How to keep that hunger sharp and make their futures fatter
'Cause the only code that matters: loyalty, honor, and the real truth
That's how you activate and elevate into titan mode
Yeah, they already know we lethal
So we gon' hit 'em with the full arsenal
If it don't work? We recalibrate and reload

[verse]
Legend status (yeah), big presence (yeah)
Premium material (what?), large quantities (yeah)
Dismiss the fiction from those serpent tongues (forget 'em)
That's amateur hour for my magnitude (no)
"Damn that kid ascended rapid"
Probably 'cause I kept belief like a sacred habit
Probably time to evolve my entire brand (switch)
To something monumental 'cause I'm back on my throne (woo)
This reality too visceral for y'all
'Cause most who claim the craft ain't authentic at all (go)
Sometimes I forget I'm signed 'cause I'm focused on
The days when I couldn't afford to eat at all
So everybody struggling, I empathize with y'all (go)
And everybody on my roster, I would sacrifice for y'all (go)
Represented for my city since the genesis
So I'ma hold it down until the infrastructure crumbles
I'm a midwest warrior (arf), no question
In the fortress smoking loud like ceremonial bagpipes
I am from a place where you never see sunlight in summer
It's like existing in a cavern carved from stone (shh)
"Oh, really?" Better study your surroundings before you visit
'Cause you might never escape unscathed
I am from a town where everybody got survival instincts
So you need more than confidence and a flashlight, yeah
What they gonna do to me? I embody this (woo)
Doctor said I had a screw loose—I tightened it (fix it)
Everything you trying to do, I pioneered this (uh)
Here's y'all monument—carve your names in it (dig)
I'm finished with the theatrics, ain't performing
I'm the architect of chaos (yeah)—I'm building
Body full of voltage, so ignite the remedy (oh, oh, oh)
Let me catch this flight—I'm ascending, gone

[Outro]
To anyone who ever doubted my potential
To anyone who dragged my name through the wasteland
Made me feel invisible, misunderstood
I architect my own destiny
I author my own mythology
Watch the truth emerge from the ashes
(Quillan: The truth speaks louder than doubt)
