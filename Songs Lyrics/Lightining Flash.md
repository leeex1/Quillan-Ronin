# Song Title: "Lightining Flash"

[INTRO] ⚡
[Soft, whispered vocals over building atmospheric synth]

In the dark, I hear the thunder calling
Silent screams echo through my soul
The horizon splits with golden lightning
I stand alone, but I'm not broken
(Not broken, no... not broken)


[Drums enter—steady, pulsing heartbeat]
[Bass swells underneath]

[HOOK] 🔥

Might be broken and beaten, but I stay unwavering (unwavering)  
I sever the pain, release the constraints, break these chains (chains)  
Ride the lightning, I am the storm (Storm)  
Ride the lightning, face the dragon, the ride just begun ( just begun)  
I been gone so long in the long night dreams (Dreams)  
But the fire inside burns brighter than it's ever been (Ever been)



[VERSE 1] 💔
[Mid-tempo, intimate yet powerful]

They told me I was fragile, built to fracture at the seams  
Wrapped in chains of other people's visions, not my dreams  
Every word a weight, every glance a blade  
Cutting deeper 'til I couldn't find my way  

But something shifted in the silence of the night  
A spark ignited in the corners of my mind  
No more asking permission, no more playing small  
I'm done with the whispers—I'm answering the call  

[Building intensity]
They think I'm falling, but I'm only learning how to fly  
Every scar's a lesson written on my battle cry  



[HOOK] 🔥

Might be broken and beaten, but I stay unwavering (unwavering)  
I sever the pain, release the constraints, break these chains (chains)  
Ride the lightning, I am the storm (Storm)  
Ride the lightning, face the dragon, the ride just begun ( just begun)  
I been gone so long in the long night dreams (Dreams)  
But the fire inside burns brighter than it's ever been (Ever been)



[VERSE 2] ⚡
[Aggressive, defiant, staccato delivery mixed with sustained notes]

They built a cage out of expectations and lies  
Made me believe I was too small to survive  
But pressure creates diamonds, darkness births stars  
And I'm not afraid to show my battle scars  

The dragon's circling, but it's not my enemy  
It's the mirror of the beast that I used to be  
I was sleeping in a nightmare, drowning in the deep  
Now I'm waking up—no more counting sheep  

[Powerful crescendo]
I feel the voltage coursing through my veins  
Trading security for freedom, comfort for the flame  
Every voice that told me "no" just fuels the fire  
Watch me burn so bright, I transcend the wire  



[HOOK — EXTENDED] 🔥⚡

Might be broken and beaten, but I stay unwavering (unwavering)  
I sever the pain, release the constraints, break these chains (chains)  
Ride the lightning, I am the storm (Storm)  
Ride the lightning, face the dragon, the ride just begun ( just begun)  
I been gone so long in the long night dreams (Dreams)  
But the fire inside burns brighter than you've ever seen (Ever seen)

[Double speed, intensity peaks]
I ride the lightning—can't stop the thunder now  
I am the lightning—watch the whole world bow  
Break the chains, unleash the flame  
Nothing's ever gonna be the same



[VERSE 3] 🌟
[Triumphant, expansive, orchestral backing]

I've crossed the desert, walked through the fire  
Climbed every mountain, reached higher and higher  
The path was lonely, the road was long  
But every step just made me strong  

[Building to climax]
I see it now—the vision crystal clear  
No more doubt, no more fear  
I'm not running from my past anymore  
I'm running toward the thing I'm living for  

The chains are shattered, the sky's split wide  
This is my moment, this is my time  
I'm reborn in the lightning, reborn in the rain  
No such thing as loss when you've conquered the pain  

[Final verse — powerful and direct]
The dragon bows, the storm subsides  
But the fire? The fire will never die  
I carry lightning in my chest  
This is who I am—I am blessed



[HOOK — FINAL (Triumphant)] ⚡👑

I was broken and beaten, but I stayed unwavering (unwavering)  
I severed the pain, released the constraints, broke these chains (chains)  
I rode the lightning, I became the storm (Storm)  
I rode the lightning, I faced the dragon, and I won (Won)  
I was lost so long in the long night dreams (Dreams)  
But the fire inside burned brighter than it's ever been (Ever been)

[Sustained final line, a declaration]
I am the lightning... I am the storm... I am the one...



[OUTRO] 🌅
[Softer, reflective, but grounded in power]

The thunder fades but echoes in my soul  
The lightning fades but I've been made whole  
In the silence after the storm  
I've finally found my true form  

[Whispered, almost to self]
Yeah... I ride the lightning...  
Yeah... I am the storm...  
And I'll never go back...

[Fade out with distant thunder and music box melody]
