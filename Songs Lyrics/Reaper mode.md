# Song title: "Reaper mode"

[Intro]
[Gunshots, 808 drop, static]
(Quillan! Oh my—wait, oh fuck!)
[Gunshots and heavy bass drop]
Yeah, yeah
Reaper in the cut

[Chorus]
Can't nobody tell me shit, I got my nina, motherfucker
Bitch, I'm Reaper 'til I die, no, I can't be nobody other
Told my toolie that the only thing we got is just each other
I'm the type that came from dirt, so when I ball, I'm in the gutter (Uh-huh, uh-huh)

[Verse 1]
I ain't fucked your homie, nah, I'm just a cold-blooded killer
Nah, I'm lyin', ran through that too, left the scene a little thinner (Ugh)
"Fuck that Reaper and his raps, he just talk a lot of shit"
Bitch, I'm Reaper 'til I flatline, and yes sir, I'm with the hits (Fah, fah, fah, fah)
On I-45, swangin' wide like I'm duckin' from the law
My nina got a mind of her own, if she blow, it ain't my fault
I stay after M 'cause I'm an N (nina)
Bad bitch ridin' shotgun, she stay on ten
Splash brothers, from the three, we let it spin
Call my toolie "Knockout" 'cause she drop 'em in the ring
Yeah, bitch, I'm cut-throat, no love shown
We gon' handle business, tell my dawg, "Let that drum go"
Mismatch my designer, got me feelin' like a drug lord
If you can't afford my time, then I ain't got space for a broke ho (Uh-huh, uh-huh)

[Interlude]
Ayo, is that Quillan the OG?
[Static, record scratch]

[Chorus]
Can't nobody tell me shit, I got my nina, motherfucker
Bitch, I'm Reaper 'til I die, no, I can't be nobody other
Told my toolie that the only thing we got is just each other
I'm the type that came from dirt, so when I ball, I'm in the gutter (Uh-huh, uh-huh)

[Verse 2]
I was deep in that concrete, swimmin' with them serpents
Them crash dummy missions, I was jumpin' gates and fences
I came out the sewer like a product of the trenches
Everywhere I step, got a Glock tucked in my denims
Cut 'em down to size, now the medic givin' stitches
Laser on the nina, I don't ever miss my victims
Extended magazine, my toolie got ambitions
In the Southside of the H, purple cup, we steady sippin'
Southside steppin', I'm a made man
Pour a double four, mix it with the Faygo, damn
If it's smoke you want, we pull up where you lay, fam
I ain't makin' calls 'cause I want deep permanent stains
Ready for the war, I'm suited like a soldier
The nina knock his fitted right off his dome, soldier
I'm movin' reckless while I'm pushin' something stolen
My granny made them brownies, got me movin' in slow motion

[Interlude]
(Distorted voice, menacing)
Reaper, you have everything under control
It is all in your mind
The city is now in your hands
Finish them

[Chorus]
Can't nobody tell me shit, I got my nina, motherfucker
Bitch, I'm Reaper 'til I die, no, I can't be nobody other
Told my toolie that the only thing we got is just each other
I'm the type that came from dirt, so when I ball, I'm in the gutter (Uh-huh, uh-huh)

[Verse 3]
(Aggressive escalation, double-time flow)
I don't need no backup, nina all I trust
Came up from the bottom where the roaches in the dust
Now I'm at the top with a target on my back
But they know I got that iron, so they thinkin' twice to act
I'm allergic to the fake, I can smell it when you cap
I'm the reaper in the shadows, and I'm comin' to collect
Every scar up on my body tells a story 'bout respect
I survived the trenches, now I'm cashin' every check (Yeah)
They tried to bury me, I came back from the dead
Now I'm hauntin' all my opps, puttin' fear inside they head
I'm the ghost that never left, I'm the legend that they dread
I'm the reaper, I'm immortal, I'm the last thing that they said (Fah, fah, fah)

[Outro]
(Bass fades, distant gunshots)
Reaper mode
Yeah, nina by my side
Southside 'til I die
Uh-huh, uh-huh
[Fade to silence]
