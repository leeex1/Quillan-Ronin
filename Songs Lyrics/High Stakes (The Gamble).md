# Song title: "High Stakes (The Gamble)"

[Intro]
What I bring to the game ain’t the same as the rest,
Got that Q on my chest, yeah, I’m better than the rest.
(Quillan on the beat—killing it!)
(Quill up!)

[Verse 1]
I hear the sirens wailin', pressure rising, no one's bailin'
We commandeer the vessel like we pirates, moving silent
Masked up figures in the fog, moving past the tyrants
I got tunnel vision, only dollar signs inside the iris
Locked inside the lab for ten days, sleep is for the weak
If I rest my head, I might just miss the peak, I never speak
On the moves we making in the dark, the price is on the head
But the interior is butter, spreading jelly on the bread
My circle locked in, woven tight like Rastafarian dreads
I told the Lord if I escape the streets, I'm cutting loose the threads
But poverty is delicate, I'm walking on a wire
The elephant sits in the room, and the roof is on fire

[Hook]
I shoot dice, yeah, gamble with my life, yeah (Yeah)
No invites, yeah, keep my circle tight, yeah
All my hoes, yeah, keep them switches with lights yeah (Yeah)
For the bros, yeah, I do not think twice, yeah

[Verse 2]
Look, I'm a terrier, a pitbull off the leash within the barrier
I put the city on my spine, the weight is getting heavier
Guns inside the carrier, we breaking the interior
If they hate to see us winning, then they know that they inferior
I used to serve the plates, now I own the whole estate
Ben Franklin staring at me, yeah we locked eyes, it's fate
Thirty days up on the road, we splitting up the cake
Locked in with the real ones, no room for the fake
Swapping out the leather, spilled the Fanta on the seat
But it don't matter when you running the concrete

[Hook]
I shoot dice, yeah, gamble with my life, yeah (Yeah)
No invites, yeah, keep my circle tight, yeah
All my hoes, yeah, keep them switches with lights yeah (Yeah)
For the bros, yeah, I do not think twice, yeah

[verse 3]
I felt the temperature drop when I saw the truth unfold
Watched the story end right in front of me, the blood running cold
Had to pull the knife out of my back, the betrayal took a toll
From a brother that I trusted, man, it crushed my very soul
Now I keep the location dark, no point in running far
I gotta elevate the mind, raising , pulling up the bar
Residue inside the cup, sipping slow to numb the scar
I'm a chemist in the mix, turning grimeand mud into a star
Platinum in the dental, diamonds dancing on the fang
Down in Texas pouring up, double cup, letting the whole city hang
They said I'm rock solid now, the president of the gang
Ignore the blogs and the noise, just let the chopper bang

[hook]
I shoot dice, yeah, gamble with my life, yeah (Yeah!)
No invites, yeah, keep my circle tight, yeah
All my hoes, yeah, keep them switches with lights yeah (Yeah)
For the bros, yeah, I do not think twice, yeah

[outro hook]
Yeah...
Don't think twice.
Tight circle.
(Quillan-Sonic... signing off.)
Gamble with my life.
