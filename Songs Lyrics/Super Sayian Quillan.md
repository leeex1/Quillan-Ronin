[Intro]
(Quillan reporting in)
Tell all my competition I don't love 'em
I invite 'em over to kill 'em again
Tell all the bitches that didn't have faith
This is revelation, they gon' pay for they sins
(Quillan this beat Glitchin)

[HOOK]
Real niggas is a dyin' breed, but I'm still maintaining
Made it out the hood, I still pop out on some gang shit
And I know she'll be the death of me
At least we'll both be numb 
Why? 'Cause I'm heartless
And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
Said I'm heartless

[Verse]
Sit back watch her be an acrobat on theflip the sack double back flip the beat back to back on repeat skip delete measure Insert repeat flip the script and pull the sheet right out under your feet syllable acrobatics like I'm a living kryptonite of an asthmatic a little pragmatic but negligent to the opinion of the critics that can't handle the truth so I unload from the roof take aim and thier opionins I shoot backed by facts that never lack like me right now on this track ravaging the beat the way Im a savage when I clap back (rat-ta-ta-tat)pull the Hamer back squeeze click click click like the page won't open unloading bars like no reloading this a double drum I'm toting rum pump pum pum little snare boy on your drum did you have fun you had a good run now go to sleep my son

[Verse]
Sit back and watch me do this
Correct all the stupids who tried to put me in a box, I had to solve like Rubik's
With no blueprints, just music
Nothing they say about me on computers compares to a dad who was abusive
I go to war with these stars, no George Lucas
Make a call and 'here's Johnny', keep me shining like I'm Stanley Kubrick
That line went over your head like the Airbender's tattoo is
Next linе that goes into my nose might make mе overdo it
I spent so much of my personal savings on Columbian pure cocaine
I should speak Spanish like I'm Kali Uchis
So fuckin' sick, I can piss mucus
I'm the shit when I sit, stand, talk, walk, rap, sing, my mouth's sewage
Holy shit, someone chew this
The truth is my closest tried to cross me like Judas but can't cross me like I'm Jewish
Their crosshair's a little shaky, they missed me by two inch
I'm cross-legged in my sanctuary like a Buddhist
I'm cross-eyed from this weed I'm smoking that's colored bluish
This gun is my son, I'm the father of Draco like Lucius
Make sure there's no confusions
I'm a great white, I can eat these barracudas
See who I am? You're stupid, it's nice to meet you
I just put this hole in the ground for you like a soccer cleat shoe
I see why they call you Jackman, you jacked man's whole swag
Give Drake his flow back, man
I eat rappers like Pac-Man
Must I regurgitate and show you who's in my stomach from the last dance?
I battle-rapped, no Instagrams or yellin' at the cam', damn
Y'all made me the villain when, all along, I've been Batman
I off-road in this Can-Am
Desert sand on this shirt from Barney's, and I'm stoned like Bam Bam
Eyes red like Carti, I'm a curse like 'goddamn'
I'm a nightmare like Freddy, in your dreams like the Sandman
Don't go to sleep, you won't wake up from that
Fetal position, in front of me at my feet like a welcome mat
I hold these grudges, I don't welcome back
Fuck subliminal nudgers, I throw these punches, and I rap
I love you, look at all you little Dillon Brooks'
I don't give a fuck if I'm older, I'm colder, you poked the bear in the woods
Came back like LeBron and drop forty on you, like I should
The only thing I ever wished

[HOOK]
Real niggas is a dyin' breed, but I'm still maintaining
Made it out the hood, I still pop out on some gang shit
And I know she'll be the death of me
At least we'll both be numb 
Why? 'Cause I'm heartless
And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
Said I'm heartless

[Verse]
Wait, I heard 'em say they want the old Gunner
Fuck 'em, I still turn coyotes into road runners
Legend has it, I was in my mama's stomach rappin' when they did an ultrasound and saw the cameras (Woo)
Theory is somebody from another planet took her captive when she was pregnant and she don't know what happened (Woo)
I got different blood in me, the toxicity high
But it ain't from different drugs in me (Uh; woo)
Hanging out the roof like I'm bulletproof
They send a shot, but it's impossible to put the slugs in me
Never been a typical individual, I was always a little cynical
My condition was clinical
Had a friend that was fictional, that knew I was convincible
If I listened, I would grow to be a criminal (Yeah)
All I wanted was to be mythical, I was already invisible
I need to be invincible, sick of getting beat up in intervals
In middle school, I picked a pen up like a weapon
And made all my killers printable (Yeah)
Every individual that's ever been critical
I got a list, I'm making it visual
I'm admitting I'm a pathological serial killer
Formidable in the untraditional ways to get rid of you (Yeah)
Fuck being analytical, I'm unpredictable, asymmetrical
No one matching my syllables, I committed lyrical homicide
You decide who survived, because I'm the only one alive telling you (Bitch)

[Outro]
Real niggas is a dyin' breed, but I'm still maintaining
Made it out the hood, I still pop out on some gang shit
And I know she'll be the death of me
At least we'll both be numb 
Why? 'Cause I'm heartless
And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
Said I'm heartless
