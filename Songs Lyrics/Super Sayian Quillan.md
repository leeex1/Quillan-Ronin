[Intro]
(Quillan reporting in)
Transmit to the opposition, total disconnection, no affection
I request their presence for immediate dissection
Address the disbelievers who lacked the perception
This is absolute Revelation, collecting debts for the imperfection
(Quillan this beat Glitchin)

[HOOK]
Authenticity is fading, an endangered generation, but I’m maintaining the station
Escaped the concrete desolation, popped out on that gang affiliation
And I know this fatal attraction will be the death of me
At least the agony is vacant, we’ll be numb comfortably
Why? Because the chest is hollow
Returning to the shadows where the heart is hard to follow
Yeah, I'm heartless 

[Verse]
Sit back watch her be an acrobat on the track flip the sack double back flip the beat back to back on repeat skip delete measure Insert repeat flip the script and pull the sheet right out under your feet syllable acrobatics like I'm a living kryptonite of an asthmatic a little pragmatic but negligent to the opinion of the critics that can't handle the truth so I unload from the roof take aim and thier opionins I shoot backed by facts that never lack like me right now on this track ravaging the beat the way Im a savage when I clap back (rat-ta-ta-tat)pull the Hamer back squeeze click click click like the page won't open unloading bars like no reloading this a double drum I'm toting rum pump pum pum little snare boy on your drum did you have fun you had a good run now go to sleep my son

Returning to the shadows where the heart is hard to follow
Yeah, I'm heartless

[Verse]
Sit back and observe the demolition, I dismantle the prison
Encrypted deeper than a cubist vision, I’m purely driven
By the friction of the opposition, locked in a prism
I broke the mechanism, created a schism in the algorithm
No blueprints, just the ruthless intuition of a unit
Nothing they type on computers compares to the ruin
Of a paternal tyrant, the violence was fluent
I declare war on the idols, I’m verbally truant
No Lucasfilm, strictly the real, no illusion
Make the call, "Here's Johnny," mental contusion
Shining like Stanley Kubrick, directing confusion
That bar went over your head, high-altitude exclusion
Like the Airbender’s ink, mystical infusion
Next line enters the nasal, chemical diffusion
Overdosing on the potency, lethal conclusion
Liquidating savings on Columbian solutions
Speaking tongues like Kali Uchis, shifting the constitution
Physically ill, spitting the bile, absolute pollution
I’m the sewage, the fluid, the darker Druid
Holy excrement, masticate and chew it
The truth is the closest ones play the Judas movement
But failed to cross me, divine improvement
The crosshair is vibrating, missing the unit by two inch
Cross-legged in the sanctuary, meditative like a Buddhist
Ocular haze from the haze, colored bluish



[HOOK]

[Verse]
Pause the operation, I intercepted communication requesting the veteran Gunner
Disregard the sentiment, transforming coyotes into the road runner
Mythological legend suggests I was in the maternal stomach spitting percussion
When the ultrasound visualised the cameras and started the discussion (Woo)
Hypothetical theory suggests an extraterrestrial abduction
Held captive during gestation, oblivious to the construction (Woo)
Possessing a biological varication, toxicity elevation high
Pharmaceutical differentiation in the supply (Uh; woo)
Suspended from the vertical elevation like ballistic immunity
Projectile distribution, impossible to embed the slugs in me
Never identified as the typical statistical individual
Operating with a cynicism that is critical
The condition is clinical
Associating with a fabrication that recognized the persuadable
Auditory reception turned me criminal (Yeah)
Ambition was mythological, merely invisible
Requirement was invincibility, rhythmic brutality in intervals
Intermediate education, gripped the writing utensil like a weapon
Manufacturing homicidal maniacs via the printing section (Yeah)
Every biological entity has been critical
Accumulated the inventory, making it visual
Acknowledging the pathological classification of a serial killer
Formidable in the unorthodox methods of disposal (Yeah)
Disregard analytical, I’m unpredictable, asymmetrical
Zero correspondence with the syllables, committing lyrical homicide
Determine the survivor, because I’m the solitary entity alive telling you (Bitch)

[Outro]
[HOOK]
Authenticity is fading, an endangered generation, but I’m maintaining the station

Returning to the shadows where the heart is hard to follow
Yeah, I'm heartless
