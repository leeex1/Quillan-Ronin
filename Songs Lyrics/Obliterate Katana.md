# Song Title: "Obliterate Katana"

[Intro]

[VERSE]
live it up like these are my last days
If time is money, I'm an hour past paid
Ugh, gunpowder in my hourglass
Niggas faker than some flour in a powder bag
Yeah, I put it down like my hands hurting
I'm on a natural high, but I land perfect
Some of us are lovers, most of y'all haters
But I put up a wall, and they just wallpaper
So love or hate me, I stay hate-free
They say we learn from mistakes; why, that's why they mistake me
I got some weight on my shoulders, to me it's like feathers
All hail Weezy, call it bad weather
I stick to the script, I memorize the lines
Cause life is a movie that I've seen too many times
You're on the outside looking in, close the blinds
And they say never say never, but fuck it, nevermind
I've been gone too long, true or false, right or wrong
Hello Weezy, welcome home, yeah

[Bridge]

[HOOK]

[VERSE]
I'm devoted to destruction
A full dosage of detrimental dysfunction
I'm dying slow, but the devil tryna rush me
See, I'm a fool for pain, I'm a dummy
Might cut my head off right after I slit my throat
Tongue kiss a shark, got jealous bitches up in the boat
Eatin' peanut butter and jelly fishes on toast
And if I get stung, I get stoked, might choke
Like I chewed a chunk of charcoal, naked in the North Pole
That's why my heart cold, full of sorrow, the lost soul
And only Lord knows when I'm coming to the crossroads
So I don't fear shit but tomorrow
And I'm a sucker for pain, it ain't nothin' but pain
You just fuckin' complain, you ain't tough as you claim
Just stay up in your lane, just don't fuck with Lil Wayne
I'ma jump from my plane or stand in front of a train
'Cause I'm a sucker for pain

[Outro]
