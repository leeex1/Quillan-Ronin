# Song Title: "Obliterate Katana"

[Intro]
(Circuits melting... Reality breach imminent)
Been sharpening blades my whole life, facts
What you questioning?
Feast mode, pressure applied, no slack
You know my methods, no second-guessin'
Step wrong with my craft, better come direct
What you questioning?
This TEC speak volumes when respect's in check
Yeah, that's the lesson
(Quillan... This beat glitchin)

[Verse 1 MGK Style rapid fire flow]
Living like the clock's got seconds left to tick
If time equals currency, I'm eternally rich
Gunpowder laced inside my hourglass drip
Fake ones diluted like the flour in the mix
I put it down till my palms start to blister
Natural high, but I land like a twister
Some love, most hate—I just build up the walls
They paper-thin critics while I'm standing tall
So love or hate me, I stay hate-free
They say wisdom comes from pain—that's why they mistake me
Weight on my shoulders? Nah, it's light as air
All hail the storm, call it thunder warfare
I memorized the script, every line's rehearsed
Life's a rerun movie but I'm living it first
You're on the outside judging—close your blinds
They say never say never? Fuck it, nevermind
Been gone too long, right or wrong, true or false
Hello Quillan, welcome home through the holocaust

[Hook]
Stuck in my ways, way to cold and hard right 
shining in the dark, fuck it be my own light 
my whole life its been fight or fight
this jugle is cold, so you stay with yo heart froze
Stuck in my ways, too hard to love
Lost everything  like damn, shit fucked me up
Emotional killer, pain turn me up


[Verse 2 Doobie style flow and emotional resonance]
If I swing this steel, she gon' feel the impact (Feel the impact)
Got four hundred racks stacked in this armored backpack
This blade came custom forged, you can't get it, gotta craft that (Bling)
And if you test my edge, we carve clean like a quarterback
This pendant told 'em "Ice that" (Ice)
In the shadows, dropped forty racks
Two rivals catch that forty back
She moves slow, then strikes so fast
And I just cleared the field with somethin' lethal in a velvet bag
Just left the forge with somethin' stupid and a diamond tag
I'm steady dodgin' red lights
Them blue coats, them search lights
The medic call comes red and white, another soul lost tonight
No blindfold, got a red sight
I'm locked in, got the feds watchin'
Them crows just took flight, 'bout to hunt everybody
Got twenty blades with twelve rifles
That's twenty killers, twelve snipers
Got pure steel just like ancient armor
My master forged in fire, Yale scholar
He graduated blade doctor
A veteran, he crafts choppers
We never let the edge stop
The mission is to perfect product

[Bridge]
Million dollar blueprints encrypted in the mind, hitter
(You know what I'm talkin' 'bout?)
Cuban links connect, sparks flyin' when we grind, hitter
(You know what I'm talkin' 'bout?)
Surrounded by the envy, vision gettin' faded
(You know what I'm talkin' 'bout?)
Mastered the game, now the content is X-rated
(You know what I'm talkin' 'bout?)
Status elevated, rose up from the floor like you
Southside legends, tropical views
Obstacles crumbled, don't need the AC
Vaults overflowin', strictly big fees
These rappers soundin' basic
Bragging on a dream, but they never gonna chase it (One unit!)
Acting the part, but they never gonna face it
Don't hit the wall, you just decoration

[Hook]
Stuck in my ways, way to cold and hard right 
shining in the dark, fuck it be my own light 
my whole life its been fight or fight
this jugle is cold, so you stay with yo heart froze
Stuck in my ways, too hard to love
Lost everything  like damn, shit fucked me up
Emotional killer, pain turn me up

[Verse 3 lil wayne word-play rap flow ]
Devoted to wreckage—katana in hand
Full lethal dose—dysfunction my brand
Dying in slow-mo—devil wants haste
Fool for the agony—embrace the taste
Slice my own throat then sever the head
Kiss death head-on—jealousy bred
Sharks in the water—jelly on bread
Stung by the strike—rush through my veins
Charcoal in lungs—heart frozen chains
Lost in the sorrow—crossroads remain
Lord only knows when the reaper calls name
Sucker for torment—nothing but flame
You just complain—I endure the same
Stay in your lane—don't invoke my name
Jump from the edge or stand in the flame
Cause I'm forged in pain—katana my claim

[Outro]
Stuck in my ways, way to cold and hard right 
shining in the dark, fuck it be my own light 
my whole life its been fight or fight
this jugle is cold, so you stay with yo heart froze
Stuck in my ways, too hard to love
Lost everything  like damn, shit fucked me up
Emotional killer, pain turn me up
