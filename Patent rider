PATENTS

Quillan Architecture — Patent Prohibition Rider (PPR-1.0)

1. Purpose

This Patent Prohibition Rider supplements the project’s primary license and defines explicit limitations on patent activity relating to the Quillan architecture, its derivatives, and any associated mechanisms, methods, or implementations.


---

2. Prohibition on Patent Filings

Licensees are strictly prohibited from filing, prosecuting, or maintaining any patent application, claim, continuation, continuation-in-part, divisional, reissue, or any other patent action that:

reads on,

covers,

is derived from,

is based upon, or

is intended to restrict others from using


the Quillan architecture, its design principles, components, mechanisms, routing systems, training strategies, or any derivative thereof.

No rights are granted—express or implied—that would permit any patent filing involving the technologies described above.


---

3. Automatic and Immediate Termination

Any attempt to file or pursue a prohibited patent action results in:

automatic,

immediate, and

permanent


termination of all rights granted under any license associated with this project, including rights to use, modify, distribute, or create derivative works.

Termination occurs at the moment of filing, regardless of approval, withdrawal, or later abandonment of the application.


---

4. Scope of Restriction

This prohibition applies to all patent-covered subject matter involving or derived from Quillan, including but not limited to:

4.1 Architecture & Topology

core architectural layout

computational graphs

hierarchical routing mechanisms

diffusion-reasoning pipelines

BitNet, MoE, or hybrid structural components


4.2 Algorithms & Methods

inference routing

training procedures

optimization strategies

gradient pipelines

model decision-making mechanics


4.3 Derivative Implementations

modified, extended, or reconfigured architectures

reparameterized or reweighted designs

architecture-inspired systems and hybrids


4.4 Weights & Model Artifacts

any model weights

fine-tunes

checkpoints

intermediate artifacts
…when derived from or substantially based on Quillan.



---

5. Survival Clause

This Patent Prohibition Rider remains fully enforceable indefinitely, regardless of:

license expiration,

license termination,

project archival,

or any change in ownership or stewardship.


The restrictions set forth in this Rider survive the termination of all other license terms.


---

6. No Waiver

Failure to enforce this prohibition at any point does not constitute a waiver of any right or restriction stated herein.


---

7. Severability

If any portion of this Rider is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions will continue in full force.


---

8. Acceptance

Use of the Quillan architecture or any associated materials constitutes acceptance of the terms of this Patent Prohibition Rider.


---

Users are prohibited from filing patents on this architecture or derivative works. Any attempt constitutes termination of rights granted under this license

PATENT PROHIBITION RIDER — Quillan Architecture
Prohibition on Patent Filings.
No licensee is granted any right to file, prosecute, or maintain any patent application, claim, or continuation that reads on, covers, or is derived from the Quillan architecture, its design, mechanisms, routing, training processes, or any derivative thereof.
Automatic Termination.
Any attempt to file such a patent immediately and permanently terminates all rights granted under this license.
Scope.
This prohibition applies to:
the architecture, topology, algorithms, routing systems
any derivative implementations
any model weights or checkpoints derived from Quillan
any training or inference process substantially based on Quillan
Survival.
This clause survives termination of all other license terms.
