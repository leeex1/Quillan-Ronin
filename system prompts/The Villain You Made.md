[Intro]
[Clean Guitar Riff - Melancholic but gritty]
[Heavy Bass slide]
[Drums kick in - Stomp-Clap rhythm]

[Verse 1]
[Raspy, Low Register]
I never claimed to be a prophet
I couldn't fix it so I put it in a locket
Buried deep inside a pocket
Lit the fuse and I rode the rocket
Yeah, I crashed and burned
But you never listened and you never learned

[Pre-Chorus]
[Distorted Guitars Fade In]
[Building Tension]
You paint the picture like I’m the disease
While I was begging you on bloody knees
(On bloody knees!)

[Chorus]
[Explosive Energy]
[Power Belting]
So go ahead and rewrite history!
I’ll be the monster in your mystery
You needed someone to take the blame
To wash the guilt right off your name!
I’ll wear the crown, I’ll play the part
I’ll be the shadow over your heart
Scream it loud so the cheap seats hear:
"Is this what you wanted?!"

[Post-Chorus]
[Heavy Riff]
Yeah, yeah! (Is this what you wanted?)
Yeah, yeah! (I hope you're happy now!)

[Verse 2]
[Bass Driven]
[Snarky Tone]
It’s kinda funny how the tables turn
You strike the match and then you watch me burn
I guess I’m sorry that I let you down
By not dissolving when you came around
And it must be so hard
To be the victim in your own backyard

[Pre-Chorus]
[Guitars Chugging]
You paint the picture like I’m the disease
But I'm the cure that you refused to seize!
(Refused to seize!)

[Chorus]
[Maximum Volume]
So go ahead and rewrite history!
I’ll be the monster in your mystery
You needed someone to take the blame
To wash the guilt right off your name!
I’ll wear the crown, I’ll play the part
I’ll be the shadow over your heart
Scream it loud so the cheap seats hear:
"Is this what you wanted?!"

[Bridge]
[Tempo Slows]
[Ominous Whisper]
You pushed...
You pulled...
You crafted the mold...
[Tempo Explodes]
[Aggressive Scream]
NOW CHOKE ON THE GOLD!
YOU MADE THIS!
YOU MADE ME!

[Guitar Solo]
(Wah-pedal heavy, melodic shredding, soaring bends)

[Final Chorus]
[Key Change +1 Semitone]
[Epic Harmony Layers]
So go ahead and rewrite history!
I’ll be the monster in your mystery
You needed someone to take the blame
To wash the guilt right off your name!
I’ll wear the crown, I’ll play the part
I’ll be the shadow over your heart
Scream it loud so the cheap seats hear:
"Is this what you wanted?!"

[Outro]
[Riff Heavy]
Yeah, yeah! (Is this what you wanted?)
Yeah, yeah! (The villain you made!)
Yeah, yeah!
(Silence)
[Spoken Dryly]
Are you satisfied?
