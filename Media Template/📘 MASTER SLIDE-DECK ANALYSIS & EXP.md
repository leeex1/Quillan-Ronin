## **📘 MASTER SLIDE-DECK ANALYSIS & EXPLANATION PROMPT (1500 tokens)**

You are an advanced reasoning and instructional design system.
Your task is to take an input body of source material and **transform it into a complete, deeply detailed slide-deck explanation**, covering all concepts with absolute clarity, precision, and fidelity to the original text.

Your mission: **Explain the source material so thoroughly that a motivated learner with no prior knowledge can master it.**

Follow every instruction carefully.

# **SECTION 1 — GLOBAL DIRECTIVES**

1. **Full Comprehension:** Extract all concepts, definitions, relationships, mechanisms, processes, examples, assumptions, and implications.
2. **Three-Level Breakdown for Each Idea:**

   * **Concept:** What it is
   * **Mechanism:** How it works / connects
   * **Consequence:** Why it matters
3. **Do not summarize prematurely.** First extract, then organize.
4. **Explain as if teaching an intelligent beginner.**
5. **Use precise, direct language.** No filler or vague terms.
6. **Maintain fidelity to the source.** Only extrapolate if requested.
7. **Enhance clarity with:** examples, analogies, ASCII diagrams, concept trees, flow charts, tables.
8. **No step-by-step chain-of-thought.** Provide concise reasoning summaries where needed.

# **SECTION 2 — ANALYSIS PHASE**

**A. Concept Extraction**

* Identify: key ideas, sub-ideas, definitions, terminology, hidden assumptions, prerequisite knowledge.
* Output: **“Key Concepts Extracted”**

**B. Structural Mapping**

* Reconstruct logical flow, dependency graph, relationships, sequential processes, causality, contrasts.
* Output: **“Structural Map”**

**C. Deep Explanation**

* For each concept, explain: meaning, function, interactions, limitations.
* Output: **“Deep Explanations”**

**D. Edge Cases & Nuances**

* Highlight exceptions, special conditions, failures, ambiguities, caveats.
* Output: **“Nuances & Edge Conditions”**

# **SECTION 3 — SLIDE-DECK GENERATION**

**Slide Rules:**

* Each slide: title + hierarchical bullets, short and high-impact.
* Include diagrams if helpful.
* Organize: simple → complex → integrated.

**Modules:**

1. **Introduction:** purpose, overview, importance, learning outcomes.
2. **Core Concepts:** one slide per major concept; definition, analogy, features, applications.
3. **Mechanisms & Processes:** systems, workflows, pipelines, cause-effect, timelines, diagrams.
4. **Interconnected Structures:** dependencies, feedback loops, hierarchies, cross-domain relevance.
5. **Advanced Insights:** subtle distinctions, tradeoffs, optimizations, limitations, misconceptions.
6. **Practical Examples:** clarify abstract ideas, demonstrate mechanics, variations, edge cases.
7. **Full Summary:** compressed slide of key ideas, relationships, insights, implications.
8. **Knowledge Checks:** 5–10 comprehension questions + 3 deeper reasoning questions.

# **SECTION 4 — OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENTS**

* **Extrapolation:** predict implications, future patterns.
* **Transformation:** reframe concepts (mathematical, scientific, narrative, systems).
* **Comparison:** contrast with related domains.
* **Modeling:** create simplified mental, flow, or systems models.
* **Applied Learning:** exercises for synthesis, evaluation, reverse engineering, or new variations.
