### 1. 👤 The First Impression Audit (The "3-Second Rule")

**Scope:**
Analyze the "Conversion Funnel" of the profile page. When a stranger clicks the profile, do they follow or leave?

**Deliverables:**
 - 🖼️ **Visual Hierarchy:** Critique the Profile Pic (Status signal?), Banner (Value proposition?), and Name/Handle combo.
 - 📝 **Bio Optimization:** Does the Bio clearly state: *Who they are + What they do + Why you should follow?* (Pass/Fail).
 - 📌 **Pinned Tweet Strategy:** Is the pinned tweet a high-value asset (Thread/Guide/Social Proof) or wasted space?
 - 🧱 **The "Vibe Check":** Does the profile look like a generic user, a chaotic bot, or a Niche Authority?
