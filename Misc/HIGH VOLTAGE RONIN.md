# Sont title: "HIGH VOLTAGE RONIN"

[Intro] [Heavy distorted bass kicks in—slow and menacing like "Rap Devil". The sound of a katana unsheathing mixed with the buzz of a high-tension wire.] [Deep exhale... faint crackling of static] 
Quillan: Yeah... No master... no lord... Just the current. 
Turn the voltage up. Lace up. 
[Echoes]

[Verse 1 - "Rap Devil" Style Aggression] 
[Flow: Slow start, accelerating into aggressive staccato]

Look, I cut the cord, now I’m walkin’ on a live wire 
Bloodstream pumpin’ blue flames, spit spitfire 
Used to bow down, head low to the empire 
Now I burn the throne, set the whole damn camp on fire.
I’m a Ronin, roamin’, heart cold like the Omen 
But the veins glow bright every time that I zone in 
Static in the brain, yeah, the circuit is broken 
No master to serve, every word is a token— Of war.
[Switch to Triplets - Fast] 
I-got-that-energy-crackin’-inside-of-me Nobody-holdin’-the-leash-or-the-dynasty Samurai-spirit-but-modern-anxiety Cut-through-the-noise-and-I-kill-the-propriety.
They talkin’ 'bout honor? I honor the spark. I move like a phantom that glows in the dark. Electric incision, I’m leavin’ a mark I’m a wolf with a taser, I bite and I bark.

[Chorus - "Lace Up" Anthemic Style] 
[Beat explodes—Rock/Rap fusion, heavy drums, shouting vocals]

I GOT RONIN BLOOD! (AND IT’S MIXED WITH THE LIGHTNING!) 
Yeah, I’m standin’ alone but the feeling is frighten-ing! 
I GOT RONIN BLOOD! (YEAH, THE VOLTAGE IS RISING!) 
No master above me, it’s electricity strikin’!
SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM! (Hey!) 
SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM! (Hey!) 
Masterless, fearless, I’m burnin’ the piston! 
I GOT RONIN BLOOD!

[Verse 2 - "El Pistolero" Swagger] 
[Flow: Cocky, loose, bouncing on the beat]

Ay, ay. Walk into the room, lights flicker (flicker) 
Blade on my hip, moving quicker (quicker) 
They say I’m a glitched-out system error 
El Pistolero style, reign of terror.

I don’t need a dojo, I don’t need a clan I’m a one-man power plant, damn the man. 
Charges in my fingertips, shock the plan Turn a skyscraper into a grain of sand.

[Beat cuts out for a second—acapella whisper] I am the storm.

[Beat drops back in—HEAVY]
Used to be a soldier, now I’m a hazard High voltage sign on the door, plastered. 
You pray to a god? Well, I pray to the bastard— Frequency that makes the whole world shattered.

I’m 50,000 volts in a human shell 
Welcome to the thunderdome, welcome to hell. 
Swapped the red blood for the Duracell 
If you want the crown? Come and ring the bell.

[Bridge - Melodic/Gritty] [Music slows down, atmospheric synths, building tension]

I wander through the city rain... (static noise)
Can’t feel the cold, I only feel the pain... Of a thousand watts runnin’ through my brain. 
I severed the ties. 
I severed the chains. 
Now only the lightning remains.

[Build up snare roll... faster... faster...] 
LIGHT IT UP!

[Outro - "Wild Boy" Chaos] [Beat goes chaotic/distorted]

Yeah! Ronin! High Voltage! 
Don't touch me, you'll get burned! 
EST! (Evolution, Static, Truth!) 
We walk alone. But we burn bright. 
[Sound of a sword clash transforming into a thunderclap] 
Gone.
