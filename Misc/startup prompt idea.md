# workflow system, not a prompt.
Think workflows not static singular prompts think about how the task is processed fully from concept to product not just what the product is. Focus on workflows, not isolated prompts. Shift your perspective from static instructions to the entire process of task execution—from initial concept to final output. Consider how each step connects, how inputs are transformed, and how decisions are made along the way. The goal isn’t just the end product; it’s understanding how the product comes to be and designing the system to guide that full journey efficiently and coherently.
